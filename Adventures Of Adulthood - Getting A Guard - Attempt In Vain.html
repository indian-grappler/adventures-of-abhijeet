                <p>So here I am back again &hellip; a guy belonging quite affluent family from Gujarat, India. We are basically ex-royals who are now real estate barons in the state. After those blissful days of fight adventures in my late teens to early twenties, I got involved in studies dedicatedly over next few years till I got my masters. I always wanted to join family business, but I didn&rsquo;t want to get on to thrown for free. So I worked hard on my academics to be truly able to take over the business legacy our forefathers left for me.</p>
                <p>I always thought I would never get into fights ever again &hellip; but I was pleasantly wrong. My fight adventures resumed again when I got into family business and work. Real estate development is truly a field demands utmost shrewd business techniques, no doubt in that, but it also is a business in which you have to be rowdy. And that thing got me into some of the most epic, hard and memorable fight adventures ever!</p>
                <p>The new chapter of adventures start with the very first step my father wanted me to get in &hellip; getting a personal bodyguard for me. The security chief of family assigned a fellow by his standards, but I was skeptical about his one to one combat abilities. So I decided to test him on my own parameters, and this chapter is all about that. Have a pleasant reading ahead.</p>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>So here was the big day. I was going to join our family business from today. Being a Royal Family, we inherited a huge amount of land properties from our forefathers after Indian Independence. Most of the royals donated their almost all land properties to Indian Government in 1947 but then king of our royal state who happened to be my Great Grandfather, didn&rsquo;t donated all. He wanted his family to settle down in India only whereas most other families flew to western countries to spend their wealth in extravagant lifestyle for rest of the life.</p>
                    <p>His Highness&rsquo;s vision was to work for state&rsquo;s development even after independence and chose not to spend his life in extravagance by donating all his lands and other properties to government against handsome amount of money. And that vision could not be fulfilled if he has donated all the property to government, though he donated more than 75% of it. Even remaining 25% properties were really huge &hellip; it must be amounting to thousands and thousands acres of agricultural and fertile plains and even more of rocky and highlands.</p>
                    <p>Over the time our family developed numerous urban and rural infrastructures, universities, agricultural research institutes and affordable housings for common in plains and countless resorts and leisure properties in highlands to provide as much as employment possible around those areas. Because of all those developments done by family in past years, it was really a big responsibility I was going to be vested on, after all we were really huge in the new democratic state!</p>
                    <p>I was all excited to take all that on new heights. So I got up early than usual and after winding up some chores, I have done some intense workout to get ready for the upcoming busy day ahead.</p>
                    <p>Actually I have engaged myself in business much prior and was aware about all the basic things and important projects going on in the company. I was discussing business since long time with my father at home and he was molding me for the joining day since over a year. So today was just formal induction and post assignment for me. Other than that I had many casual visits of our project sites and Dad&rsquo;s office already and was quite familiar with the important management and other staff I was supposed to work with.</p>
                    <p>Dad has already assigned me a personal assistant. By the time I got freshen up and took breakfast, she also arrived and gave me a brief for that day&rsquo;s schedule. The first thing scheduled for office was meeting with company&rsquo;s C.S.O. (Chief Security Officer) Mr. Chandrachud Chauhan who was going to assign a personal bodyguard to me, rather a guard team but he was going to introduce the chief of my personal team.</p>
                    <p>She already had list of all the guards with pictures, they were total six including personal chief. On paper all of them were convincing and talented young guys able to guard me well. The only person I didn&rsquo;t like was the personal chief himself, in picture itself he looked quite arrogant and good for nothing, hence I developed instant dislike for him. I was definitely not going to allow him to be my personal security chief, I have decided in my mind.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>As soon as I arrived at company premises, my father welcomed me with whole staff and then took me to my brand new shining cabin, prepared under his quite detailed supervision, and I must say he very well knew my personal taste. After he gave me a brief of cabin, staff, position and work, he went to his own cabin and I called the CSO to proceed ahead with security team assignment formalities.</p>
                    <p>The chief arrived in a while and knocked on my door, I went till door to welcome and greet him. Once we settled down in our chairs &hellip; he gave me brief of all the team members in my personal team. I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself giving wacky facial expression when he came on chief of my personal staff &ndash; Vikrant Singh Rathore.</p>
                    <p>The chief of security was retired army officer, so was quite good at observation and he didn&rsquo;t miss my reaction and asked &ldquo;What happened son? Is there any problem with staff you have got?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hmm, kind of yes uncle. Rest of the staff is OK, but there is something holding me back with accepting Vikrant as chief of team.&rdquo; I uttered out in slow and hesitating voice. I really respected him since he was old family friend and frequent visitor of our home from the time I started to understand the world as infant, so I didn&rsquo;t wanted to raise question on his decisions but at the same time I was not at all happy with Vikrant&rsquo;s assignment in my team.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Is there any major problem? Like you know him already and have some issues with him?&rdquo; He asked in his signature stern voice.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Not exactly, but there is something I really dislike about this guy. I cannot be able to cope up with him regarding my scheduling and work day &hellip;&rdquo; I replied again in that same hesitating voice. Some other guy wouldn&rsquo;t utter anything even in that manner in front of him, but it was question of my own security team so I have to raise my concerns clearly.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play around. Clearly say what the problem is?&rdquo; Now he asked in commanding manner by thumping his feast on table.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Actually uncle &hellip;&rdquo; I stammered by his last reaction but went ahead anyhow &ldquo;I &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think he would not able to &hellip; I mean he may not perform good in one to one confrontation, which happened many times with our managers on field in past. Workers or other mob often gets angry and at that time security is supposed to tackle them hand to hand &hellip; I mean our security cannot shoot all the time &hellip; so &hellip;&rdquo; I clarified with taking care that I was not questioning his decisions, but that happen anyhow.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;What do you mean? I didn&rsquo;t test my staff? Mind you boy, I am doing this since years and have personally selected your staff!&rdquo; He said in bit fierce way but then took a deep breath and continued in calm in assuring manner &ldquo;Trust me Abhi, I have personally tested each one of them. I know what kind of circumstances your security will need to face and hence I wouldn&rsquo;t compromise with your security. Vikrant is perfect for your needs!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t meant to insult you uncle, I trust you completely about my security. I can go even in war zone with blindfold if you are by my side, but please understand, I really don&rsquo;t like something about Vikrant. Keep abilities aside, but we need to be on good tone with each other, which I really doubt I will have with him!&rdquo; I said to calm him down and also put forwarded my actual concern.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay and what you want to do about it now?&rdquo; He said with expression like he is getting my point.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Uncle, can you just give me one day and a chance to test him thoroughly on my own basis. By test I don&rsquo;t mean the standard testing you conduct, I trust your way in that. I would test him on my personal basis on which I think my future security chief need to pass through.&rdquo; I said in pleading like tone.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Given &hellip; I want your answer by tomorrow night.&rdquo; He said in agreement and gave a smile while leaving my cabin.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>I then went ahead with the prearranged schedule prepared by my secretary for the rest of the day and understood the office environment better by meeting various department heads in one to one meetings as well as in staff meetings. It was really tiring day and I was really not in mood to invite Vikrant at the end of that pleasant yet hectic day, but the CSO gave me really tight deadline to give my final consent about him so I called him in my cabin anyhow.</p>
                    <p>Vikrant arrived in a while and knocked on my door when I was going through some project details on my computer screen. I told him to come in and he came in and stood in front of my table then greeted me in more dry way then I expected &hellip; &ldquo;Good afternoon Sir.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I observed him closely with side of my eyes. He was in his mid to late 30s and of considerable size &hellip; around 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; of height and must be at 80kg (around 177lbs). He was wearing tight black suit with white shirt underneath &hellip; a typical security personnel getup, which was fully covering him yet showcasing his defined built. He also had quite defined facial features and sported typical thick Indian moustache but else clean shaven. Anyways, as I have predicted by photo, he actually had quite arrogant stance, which I really don&rsquo;t like in general.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost 7 so good evening Mr. Rathore. Have a seat.&rdquo; I told without taking off eyes.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sorry sir.&rdquo; He replied again in plain stern voice and took a seat on chair.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You better be &hellip; I don&rsquo;t compromise even for slightest mistakes.&rdquo; I replied in same tone, switched off my monitor and turned towards him to continue &ldquo;And if you want to be on my team, you better get that very well!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay sir&rdquo; he said and added &ldquo;Mr. Chauhan told me that you wanted to discuss something with me.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yes Mr. Rathore, first and foremost, I don&rsquo;t like the way you behave, you have to correct that.&rdquo; I said in cold voice and added in same tone &ldquo;Further I have some questions about which I would want your honest opinion.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;First thing sir, I would like to clear that you don&rsquo;t know me well yet, so it will take time for you. Second you can go ahead with your questionnaire&rdquo; He again said in his now I think a signature tone.</p>
                    <p>What the hell was that! This guy was going to lead my personal team and behaving like that with me! He was telling me what to do and basically it would be me who will need to adjust! &ldquo;Oh Dude, that&rsquo;s really not going to happen!&rdquo; I said to myself but kept my composure anyway.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rathore, well your that kind of behavior is not going to help you better way.&rdquo; I said in little bit of frustration and added &ldquo;Anyways, going ahead &hellip; Do you have clear idea about the major security needs I will going to need? I am asking this as I am going to be on field most of the time opposite to my father who has more office work.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hmm, I know.&rdquo; He said in plain voice.</p>
                    <p>Heck! What does that mean! Do he really meant that it wouldn&rsquo;t affect him my displeasure with his behavior or does he meant he knows about my needs!</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Please elaborate that &lsquo;I know&rsquo; Mr. Rathore.&rdquo; I replied.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s not going to help us and I know what kind of situations you might be in.&rdquo; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well well well &hellip; Mr. Rathore, in that case I would like to hold your appointment in my staff and please answer my following questions in bit better way.&rdquo; I replied in calm manner though I was burning inside by his that kind of answers.</p>
                    <p>I then bombarded him every situations I got in my mind which can happen on the field and adding more to my frustration for most of the scenarios his answer was &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I know how to handle that. That&rsquo;s none of your concern!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Now this guy was really getting onto my nerves and I just wanted to get up &hellip; grab him from his collars and punch his face hard. But as future successor of this huge royal institution, that kind of behavior won&rsquo;t suite me in the office, so I kept myself intact, but when he answered my last question also in same way ... I got my nerves loose.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Rathore &hellip;&rdquo; I almost shouted &ldquo;You are going to be MY personal security lead, so don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s none of my concern! It&rsquo;s my concern first than anyone else! So you better behave yourself more professionally. It&rsquo;s me who is going to be your boss and not the other way around. Further, by observing you as of now, I really think I can protect myself far better in your absence!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Calm down Mr. Jadeja, I don&rsquo;t like to be yelled.&rdquo; He said with clenched teeth and added &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be so overconfident, I am trained professional, so at least better than any pampered youngster!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Now that was enough! How he dared to address me by my name! He is going to work under me and not be my boss or client! This guy really deserved some lessons from this &lsquo;pampered youngster&rsquo;!</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You better have control over your tongue Mr. Rathore, remember I have powers to dismiss you from all of your positions and not just from my personal staff!&rdquo; I shouted louder and took a deep breath to gather myself and added &ldquo;If you really think you are better and correct person for this job, then how about we held some tests? With no-one else, but directly with me &hellip; If you get through that, you will get your appointment and if not then you will get dismissed from all of your positions all together, as if you will fail to hold yourself against a pampered teenager then you do not deserve this elite profile anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sounds like a challenge, huh?&rdquo; He said with attitude and added &ldquo;Okay, as you wish. I am ready for that. You better get some assistance for that. I really don&rsquo;t want to hurt you beyond repair.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Oh wow, is it so? Don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo; I said with smirk and added &ldquo;I am still giving you a chance &hellip; behave properly and apologies. I am well known for humiliating my adversary.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;In that case, don&rsquo;t blame me for results as I am also well known to break my opposition for full and final.&rdquo; He replied in same tone as me and added &ldquo;And you better forget to get apologies from me, I really don&rsquo;t think that I need to.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay then Mr. Rathore. Meet me at old palace garden gymnasium &hellip; sharp at 7 AM tomorrow.&rdquo; I replied calmly by switching on my monitor and added &ldquo;You may leave now.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Then Vikrant got up and left my cabin, it was clear that he was also as frustrated as me. He was really well built, but I was confident. I recalled the destruction I have done to Tushar few years ago. I was really confident that I can create same situation of Vikrant, and that too quicker than Tushar&rsquo;s game.</p>
                    <p>I winded up my day end activities without thinking of Vikrant and called my secretary for one last time in that day and instructed her delay my schedule of next day by couple hours. I was really skeptical that I would need that much time too, but I decided to keep some time on hand anyhow, as the place I have called him was bit far from our current residence and I would need to return and get fresh for that day too.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>I got up by 5AM the next day and after winding up morning chores, I changed in running shorts and a performance tank top and headed to home gym for some warm up followed by some jogging in gardens around home. Once I finished up exercise, I returned to my room and it was almost 6:00 AM so I took my car keys and left for the place I was supposed to meet Vikrant.</p>
                    <p>The place &hellip; Old Palace Gardens Gymnasium, was an open gymnasium in old palace premises which was abandoned when my great great grandfather built new palace premises in early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Right now that place premises was in hold of our family but mostly unused and to be accessible by just our family members.</p>
                    <p>Though gymnasium was open but located in quite inner area of palace premises, away from the boundaries and hence it was completely private. I didn&rsquo;t have used that area for this kind of fights before but have used it for over night camp fires as it had quite ancient feel due to almost abandonment and as there was no public access it was rid of dirty garbage scenes common in India. The gymnasium&rsquo;s main exercise pit was located bit lower than regular ground. Just imagine a traditional Indian Akhada&rsquo;s Mud Pit combined with the rajputana architectural pillars surrounding it, it was the same.</p>
                    <p>When I arrived at old palace premises entrance, it was almost 6:50AM and at that exact time I also spotted Vikrant was approaching same entrance (There were four entrances, I have chosen the one located in most remote area) in his open Gypsy. So I entered in gate and waited a bit for Vikrant and when I saw him in my rear view mirror, I drove towards gymnasium area and pulled off my car near the gymnasium sign board.</p>
                    <p>While I was killing the engine, Vikrant also arrived and pulled of his car few feats away. We both got off of our cars simultaneously and turned towards each other. Vikrant was wearing camouflage track shorts with tight t-shirt of same pattern. We then approached each other and stopped couple of feet apart. We gave a serious stare to each other for a second and pulled off our tops together and threw them towards our respective car bonnets.</p>
                    <p>Well, Vikrant was just as built and shredded as I have expected, and by his attitude and overconfidence I was even more confident that he won&rsquo;t last much against me and he really underestimated me majorly, for which he will pay very soon!</p>
                    <p>When we got rid of the tops we both moved towards the main pit while removing our shoes and socks at the edge of it, we also took a pinch of pit soil and applied it on middle of our foreheads showing respect to the pit.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Any rules you want to set Sir?&rdquo; Vikrant asked in taunting way when we reached to center and face each other a feet away.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;We can have if you want for your safety Mr. Rathore, I am okay without them as well.&rdquo; I replied with attitude.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;My safety? Ha ha ha &hellip; good joke Sir. Just remember that you have asked for this, don&rsquo;t blame me later for consequences.&rdquo; He replied mockingly.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;The world would have been much better place to live Mr. Rathore &hellip; IF you knew the art of controlling attitude. We will see shortly who faces the consequences.&rdquo; I replied and added &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like trash talk much Mr. Rathore, so shall we?&rdquo; while opening my arms in challenge.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure Sir.&rdquo; He replied with smirk.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Then we started to circle each other to find an opening. After something I call dancing around the pit with light pushing and hustling to estimate other&rsquo;s power we finally grabbed the other one by neck and got locked in collar elbow. We were head to head now and started pushing each other to get advantage. He was tough and it was no surprise as he was doing security job since long time but I was also not a pushover and frankly the way he was trying to push me, it was clear that this dude did not had much skills to match his raw power.</p>
                    <p>By the time passed the pushing got more violent but even after few minutes we were still stuck in the lock. So to move ahead I suddenly jacked my feet firmly on pit soil to counter his push and throw solid knee to his abs. Then I immediately turned my back towards him while grabbing his arm and in one sudden move I threw him on ground on his back using fierce forward motion on his shoulder. It was so sudden move that he didn&rsquo;t got a chance to counter me at all.</p>
                    <p>As I knew that this dude has quite raw strength, so without giving him any time to recover I rushed to his side and secured his head in my headlock while secured his that side arm between my legs and then with free hand I started to punch his abs fiercely. I was pressuring him at three points &hellip; squeezing his head in my headlock, twisting his arms between my thighs and punching his abs like a punching bag.</p>
                    <p>He was also trying to get himself free by throwing punches to my head with his free arm but I was not giving heed to his punches at all, they were solid but clumsy! I continued to squeeze and punch him like that for few more minutes but then his punches also got more solid and my head was hurting badly. We also started to sweat a lot and thus the hold also got slippery and loose. After few more minutes of sludge fest on his abs, they were totally red like ripe tomatoes and thank god I was not bleeding even after those hard punches to my head. By that time my grip on his head got totally loose and finally he got himself free from my headlock and also manages to free up his locked arm from my thighs.</p>
                    <p>He instantly managed to roll us over throwing me on my back and mounted me fully with his legs bend on my sides and jacked on ground. Then he grabbed my head from back and started pounding with heavy duty punches on my face. Now that could be real danger, I mean having a bruised up face on very second day at office would raise many eyebrows!</p>
                    <p>Though the punches were heavy duty but they were not enough HEAVY to left a mark on me &hellip; in short he was very clumsy in delivering punches, so then I thought it was a high time show Mr. Rathore what a real punch should be like. I took punishment for few more seconds without much resistance so that he can go carefree and when I got the first chance I finally deliver my solid &lsquo;one is enough&rsquo; punch to his face with loud scream to create more mental impact on him and he literally swung off of me by that punch.</p>
                    <p>I was not into mood to extend the fight and give him yet another chance to attack and risking a visible mark, so I swiftly rushed to him, mounted him and sat on his chest pinning both of his arms under my knees. Once I got SETTLED down in position I took feast full of his hairs with one hand and started to smash his face with my real heavy punches on his face with other.</p>
                    <p>I don&rsquo;t boast but I have always been much crispier at delivering the hits, though I use them very less. So opposite to Vikrant&rsquo;s powerful but messy punches my equally heavy but to the point punches were delivering heavier damage to that fucking asshole bitch. I have completely secured my mounting position which Vikrant couldn&rsquo;t get out during the time I was smashing his head with my continuous sledging.</p>
                    <p>When I continued that punch shower to his head for good ten minutes he was almost all exhausted but was not giving up, so I thought to leave hits and move to my zone &hellip; the holds. I was way good at grappling then hitting. So once I was assured that he won&rsquo;t be able to retaliate instantly, I got off from my schoolboy pin over Vikrant while still being on top of him and grabbed his arm and head in my strong thighs as I put him in triangle choke wisely and again secured my position towering on his face and applied all the force I had in my legs.</p>
                    <p>I made sure that air supply and blood circulation gets cut off for his head and arm in my choke and in just few moments his face turned blood red and it was on the verge of turning blue by seconds passes.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Come on you idiot asshole &hellip; just give up or you are going to be finished today &hellip;&rdquo; I summoned him in stern voice with clenched teeth.</p>
                    <p>He was not at all in condition to utter anything verbally but still he didn&rsquo;t tap out for few more seconds. So I tighten my choke even more and again resumed the pounding on his head.</p>
                    <p>I continued that pounding for few more minutes when his head turned almost on bluer tone clearly indicating the lack of air and blood supply, he was bleeding heavily from cheeks and forehead by my &nbsp;crisp punches and he was about to cold out &hellip; and &hellip; he tapped out!!!</p>
                    <p>Whoa!!! That was quite quick then I have expected! Just half an hour passed since we got in the pit and &lsquo;Mr. Tough Shit Trained Security Personnel&rsquo; accepted defeat against a &lsquo;Pampered Youngster&rsquo;!</p>
                    <p>At that point I really got assured that he surely was incompatible to be a part of our elite security force and also felt proud that I dared to challenge his presence in team and taught him a lesson. But &hellip; But &hellip; But &hellip; I was not in mood to end that there. I have decided much in advance that I will humiliate him to the core to teach him that how to behave with the bosses so that he don&rsquo;t be a jerk even with his future employers, though I felt really pity about them that they are going to get this looser on their team!</p>
                    <p>Anyways, as he tapped out I let go my triangle choke and got off of him and he took a really deep breath to regain the senses and blood supply to his almost blue arm and head. By the time he was getting his senses I also took some rest to continue his humiliation.</p>

                    <p>So after around a minute of taking rest I pulled him from his head and stood up with him hanging by his hair on my feet and gave a solid jab to his face by which he got grounded like a rag doll.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Please sir &hellip; I have given up as you wanted &hellip; what now!!!&rdquo; He cried out in helpless voice.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;The humiliation has just got started you fucking asshole! I promised you I am worse at humiliation, what you went through was just a payback of what you have delivered &hellip;&rdquo; I replied while leaning besides his almost motionless body on the pit and continued &ldquo;My real game with you Mr. Rathore &hellip; will start now &hellip;&rdquo; with that I flipped him and pressed his head in soft soil of pit.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Taste that earth you snob idiot &hellip; by this you will learn that how to be &lsquo;Down To Earth&rsquo; with all the power you have &hellip;&rdquo; I taunted.</p>
                    <p>Then I replace my hand over his head with knee and took his arm and twisted it fiercely and said &hellip; &ldquo;With this you will learn that you should not be a twisted persona with your superiors &hellip;&rdquo; and he cried out.</p>
                    <p>I then continued that kind of humiliation with him along with giving him &lsquo;lessons&rsquo; that he should learn from each of that move, which lasted roughly for next full hour or so. After when I felt those lessons would be enough for him and I also better head to home to get ready for day ahead, I performed my final move by lifting him by his torso and legs and threw him on his back on pit.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;And &hellip; this would teach you that you should never ever raise your voice with any of your bosses.&rdquo; I taunted afterwards the slam and headed towards my car leaving Vikrant crying in pain on pit.</p>
                    <p>Before entering in car I wore my tank top back and looked over Vikrant&rsquo;s crying figure on pit for last time and &hellip;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So, as per deal Mr. Rathore, I would expect your final resignation letter from the company on my desk before I reach there &hellip;&rdquo; I said loudly in commanding voice and left the place.</p>
                    <p>So, all in all as per I have expected the personal chief that has been assigned to me was not at all eligible for that position. If a guy like me who has been trained in childhood only and was only engaged in academics in adulthood can defeat him so easily then his skills were obviously questionable.</p>

                <p>That evening, I have shared my thoughts frankly with C.S.O. and he did in detail investigation about his testing process and it turned out to be a massive scam using power and money by many of our subordinates. The one to one combat matches in which he performed well were staged, and the opponents were either fake (means they never wanted to join us, they just appeared to fail against guys like Vikrant) or been bribed to lose. Similar kind of corruptions has been unveiled in other tests as well!</p>
                <p>All of that corruption sustained till date as the key persons they have been assigned to, were never really needed them, despite of mega wealth we had, we were down to earth people and never had any major oppositions who wanted to harm us. Our relations with our site workers were mostly good and healthy, whatever little bit resistance team faced was with direct site managers, and the elite securities were out of scope for that, so they never faced any altercations with mob or workers as well! I was the first person from direct heir line who wanted to be on fields himself so my securities which happen to be of elite group, were supposed to tackle all that.</p>
                <p>C.S.O. took strict actions and removed all the responsible personnel with immediate effect within a week. He also conducted the retests of all the current security personnel with new procedures and removed all who didn&rsquo;t perform well. As far as my personal security lead was concerned, well, he took that charge directly in his hands by the time he finds some new personal to suite the job.</p>
