                    <p>After very hard fight, Jaimin submitted to my bearhug in first round. I just released from my hug and now we were on cotton matt side by side, breathing heavily. We stayed at our places for quite some more time to recover from tiredness off our last round. After that we stood up and gave each other a friendly hug as a signal of undisputed and healthy ending of first round.</p>
                    <p>Then we went to our respective corner to get ready for second round. This time we were in more competitive mood then the first round as we both starring at each other with poisonous feeling, but somehow it was just competitive feeling not hate rate. During getting ready for the fight we dint took our eyes off from another, and slowly we both took our dhoti up from ankle length and pulled it till mid-thigh length. And tied up other end at our waist only.</p>
                    <p>Now our dhotis were more looking like langot (please refer first part to know what langot exactly is.). And in that attire our thighs get opened up to another. I just had look at his thick thighs and it was looking as powerful as mine. I must say Jaimin has got slickest and sexiest thighs I have ever seen in real. We were almost in boxer briefs type of gear just imagines it little bit fluffier.</p>
                    <p>He also observed me from head to toe but this time his look was like as if he is rating me and planning how to defeat his opponent when he already lost his first round against his childhood buddy. After we done with our dhoti he went to other room to take the coin for coin tossing which will decide the position in knee and palm starting position.</p>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>He entered again in the room having a Rupee coin in his hand and handed it to me to check. I returned it to him after making sure the coin is genuine.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;HEAD OR TAILS?&rdquo;, he said straightly</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Heads&rdquo; I said and Jaimin flipped the coin into the air and&hellip; its head, yuppie I won the toss&hellip;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Congrats, let me show what you have got but remember I am next&hellip;&rdquo; and he leaned to take the position&hellip;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hmm I won the toss&rdquo; I said after bit thinking &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my right to take the decision about position, am I right Jaimin?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yea sure, but why are you asking this?&rdquo; he replied dough fully &ldquo;what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So as toss winner my decision is that that you take upper position this time I will be on top in next round.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; he stood up in confusion &ldquo;but why you want to give up your first chance?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I just want to prove you that position doesn&rsquo;t mater for me, I can beat you even if I start from underneath position&rdquo; I gave him a faint smile, but actual thought in my mind was let first know what has Jaimin got, let him experimenting on me so I can use it in last round, and if I won this round then also I can boast that position doesn&rsquo;t matters for me as I am better than him.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;oh just don&rsquo;t boast too early, still two rounds are left and we will see after these rounds only that who is looser and who is real winner.&rdquo; He said in annoyance and gestures me to take the position.</p>
                    <p>I leaned on the matt on my knees and placed my palms also on matt and took a firm position and Jaimin came to take his position and sat on right side of me. He took his position as one knee and one feet on ground and leaned on top of and slide his right arm underneath me across my chest and grabbed my left arm, while with the other hand he hold me from my lower waist.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asked after he took his position.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Always ready to kick your ass you punk&rdquo; I said in taunting way to let come out his fierce as I felt that he was not putting all his strength in first round, so I decided to tease him so that his anger came out of him and he can put some more hard fight against me as I was a fan of very equally proportioned match.</p>
                    <p>And my arrow just hit the target and I can feel his fierce even in starting hold&hellip;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So just wait and watch and let&rsquo;s get started my friend&hellip;&rdquo; he said in fierce and the round two is just BANG ON started&hellip;</p>
                    <p>He was so desperate to fight that he all of sudden jerk me in the air by my waist and slammed me on the mat&hellip; before I can understand what&rsquo;s going on I was on the matt with my face down and Jaimn was on my back with his belly down and pushing my neck with his right elbow and held my arms on my back in between his belly and my back and putted all of his body pressure on my back so I cannot free myself.</p>
                    <p>He started jerking my body fiercely from side to side. He was in great offense, I never ever saw this part of his personality in past, and was just in thought that he is just boasting about his street brawls and how he harmed his enemy, but now I came to know that it was all fact and kid is really strong if wants to be strong and wants to win in any which case.</p>
                    <p>He was in his full force so I also decided to take this fight more seriously than just getting touch of smooth male skin and I also showed the speed in fight and any how got my arms free from him and rapidly inverted myself, now I was facing him face to face, belly to belly and tried to get control over this wild horse, but I think it was just too late as before I can gather myself from his first offence I was again in his control and this time in worst situation he just locked my arms on the mat with the help of his powerful arms and pressure on my wrists was so intense that I started to feel burning by his hold.</p>
                    <p>My lower body was also not in good situation as it was captured by Jaimin&rsquo;s strong thighs as he applied full body scissors on me. As we were in lesser clothes the more skin was exposed. That&rsquo;s why he got even tighter grip on me as compared to silk dhoti covering his strong thighs.</p>
                    <p>One side the intense fight was harassing me then on the other side the bare touch of another powerful man was distracting me as I got little Bonner by his touch of bare thighs. But somehow I recovered and recalled myself from naughty thoughts and came into harsh reality that I was badly in controlled by two years younger and even softer kid. It was really embarrassing that a younger and softer guy putting you in this type of situation.</p>
                    <p>So I also let out my anger and started a powerful defense against his fierce power. I just jerked my body up with force and slammed my torso with his, but no result as he was in full force. But I cannot give up in just two minutes as this kid also gave up after putting fight and defense till almost 20 minutes. I have to give a strong fight if I want to maintain my personality before him.</p>
                    <p>So I slammed our torso once again in full force but still he again captured me in same situation I was in. so I just thought to change my direction of try. So I decided to attack him in different way. So this time I slammed our torsos in little cross, like I gathered all my power and jerked myself up in full speed and slammed my left shoulder with his left shoulder.</p>
                    <p>This time I got success to break his balance and got my at least one arm free from his fierce hold, this time I showed a lot quickness then ever before and grabbed his neck from back and pressed his head in chest.&nbsp; But he was getting smarter by the time I think, as he started to attack on my head with his free arm. He was literally twisting my head back side with his right arm, I was feeling extreme pressure on my throat and while with another arm he was twisting my another arm as well. He keeps me in his control for almost 10 more minutes.</p>
                    <p>But again we get sweaty by the time and got our contact surface wet and slippery by that. So I decided to take advantage of the situation and more I also had his head in control so he was also got weaker during this time. So I suddenly showed rapid speed and slipped out side from his scissors and rapidly sat on my knees and grabbed him by his arms. Now we were on our knees and hustling to get another down. He was so in mood of fight that he made even hustling a big task of defense to be done for me.</p>
                    <p>We were pushing another to backwards with using all the body pressure we had. He suddenly slightly stood up and pushed me in so force that I lost my balance and slammed on to the matt once more. He just got this opportunity and vined his thick thighs around my neck and started giving tremendous pressure on it, the pressure was so high that all I can do is to attempt useless trials to get him distracted by hitting him in back, in thigh and just this kind of things.</p>
                    <p>But nothing worked actually, what I could during all this time is slowly and gradually headed towards his head to grab him also in leg scissors but he was tough and smarter guy. He was just keep escaping from that situation. But I have also decided that if I am going to lose this round &hellip; its completely fine, but I cannot let him win without having a hard fight. So I continued my trials, after almost 15 minutes I got him in my trap as due to slippery contact surface somehow I managed to maneuver myself towards his head and by showing quick response I grabbed his head with the help of my legs and I also started to giving pressure on his neck in head scissors&hellip;</p>
                    <p>Now we were in mutual head scissors with our arms trying to getting our self free from our opponent. He just grabbed me in inverted sleeping bear hug and grabbed my lower waist in to his hug. I was also facing his crotch so I also applied the same thing on me. Now we were in sort of 69 position head scissors and rolling with that situation across the room so we can get upper hand over other.</p>
                    <p>As I said that it been long time that I was in control of him I was completely strained after 10 more minute of mutual scissors and almost 30 minutes of round. I was literally exaggerated. As I said the kid is clever and smart so he predicted my situation and taken advantage of it. And leave me from the scissors and quickly came towards me and tossed me on my belly to the mat and crawled on me and slipped his right arm from my back and take me in tight headlock. He was applying so intense pressure that I started to lose my vision and my face turned blue by lack of enough oxygen.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t be so jerk Abhijeet, give up, or else you will not go at your home on your legs dude&hellip; and I mean it&rdquo; he said fiercely and almost in commanding tone.</p>
                    <p>I felt he was right and it's good to give up at this time, so I quickly tapped on his arm and that&rsquo;s how our second round gets over by my shaming give up. Jaimin let me go but totally dominated me throughout the round. But I was happy that I am in one piece to play the third round.</p>
