                    <p>After my last fight with my best friend Jai I knew that I had Bisexual flinch and then tried for proper male to male sex also, but can&rsquo;t get much success as I was not enjoying it. So what I got by this was I like male touch but during fight I used to get boner and used to get discharged even, so I figured out that I like just erotic fight in gay side of my personality so after that I never gone for the pure sex but at the same time I was not getting what I actually want as I belong to upper and educated orthodox Guajarati background where even fun fights are not so welcomed.</p>
                    <p>But there is one guy in our neighborhood with whom I used to share my experiences but I was hesitating to share my fight with Jai for two reasons, first he just hated Jai and second he was looking like complete heterosexual guy to me.</p>
                    <p>Yes you can say that he is my childhood buddy. His name is Jaimin and two years younger than me. Height is just same as me, may be one two inch shorter but not much difference and weight is also almost same. He normally looks little bit weaker than me as he had slight softer body then me, and I also used to think the same so I never fought with him. But one day we were enjoying rain on his roof and were doing some fun along with his younger brother Ankit. At that time he got some stick and start playing with it, I just saw him and tried to take it from him, but he dint want to give that to me and he engaged me in little bit of hustling. At that time I realize that he is not that weak as I was thinking.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>The day after we were relaxing at his home as it was vacation going on and his parents went out of station with his younger brother, so we were alone at his home as well. So we just switched on the TV we were surfing through the channels and saw one channel was showing program on Indian Traditional Kushti (Traditional Indian Mud Wrestling). He stopped the surfing and stuck on that channel as half naked men were doing traditional Indian mud wrestling, especially when wrestler takes fight to ground he got more exited, so I got little bit signal of my interest.</p>
                    <p>So I just said to him &ldquo;hey Jaimin, do you like that kind of thing?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah sure, I am just fan of this. The pure manly game I have ever seen. Just a man on man, one on one, just in dhoti or may be lungot(kind of loin cloth and similar to dhoti but shorter than that, just hiding the butt and crotch) mano-o-mano . Feeling each other&rsquo;s power directly without any sort of gloves or anything else.&rdquo; He replied without taking his eyes off from the TV.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So, you like it Hahn! Did you ever tried it with someone yourself?&rdquo; I asked</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sort of no, like as I am bit short tempered person I had fight with many guys In school and college, but not this type of proper wrestling scenario, all of that was just street brawls nothing more&hellip;&rdquo; he said normally.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Then why dint you challenge any opponent for the proper wrestling, this way can do both, like beating down that guy and experience your favorite sport&rdquo; I replied significantly.</p>
                    <p>During the time show gets over so he turned off the television and turned towards me and replied with innocent little laugh:</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Samarat as I told you, all of were street fights in adrenaline rush, who aware about challenging one another for later proper fight, second do you think I can get him alone for the fight in private as we are living in the most populous and orthodox city (at least for combat sports) of Gujarat?&nbsp; And third thing I would prefer this type of thing as healthy and friendly competition not as hateful brawl.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you tried with some of your school or college friend? &ldquo;I asked</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Abhijeet, how many times I should remember you that we are in Gujarat, here even mentioning about having kushti is almost taboo so just forget about having it with any guy in real. And more who can be ready for this? Here almost every person either&nbsp; consider it as very rough and down-market violent option of sports as we are living in the birth and work area of national father the great Mahatma Gandhi&nbsp; and living in the same city from where he started his idea of Non-Violence movement or taking it as a thing for gay satisfaction. &rdquo; he replied in frustrated voice, I figured out he was frustrated because he cannot experience the best thing he knew just because we are in non-violent state of India and the dry state for alcohol the great GUJARAT.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay but you should discuss it with somebody.&rdquo; I replied to predict his thought.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;What you think? I dint tried? I tried my friend and I got all this INFORMATION by that only, and who were interested also, either they were too big and dominating or too lean and girlish. When I want equally matched manly opponent for good, healthy, fair and give-n-take fight, I just hate the concept of one sided fight. I mean what&rsquo;s excitement there in the competition where result is known at the very starting of it?&rdquo; he replied like annoyed child.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay, so if you can get that kind of opponent then will take on him just at the moment or will think for a moment?&rdquo; I asked precisely.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I will off course grab the opportunity, but why are asking this?&rdquo; he said as he look at me from head to toe and something in his mind.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Nothing, I just know one guy around you who also like all this and in the same way as you like&hellip;&rdquo; I said as I winked, and I think he got the signal as well</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Ohh in that case I would like to plan proper fight sequence, you know it&rsquo;s my CHILDHOOD DREAM&rdquo; he said as he stood up and stretched himself and came and seat on the same sofa as me.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;A planed fight? I thought you like genuine fight.&rdquo; I asked doughtily.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Ohh Abhijeet not a planned fight! &nbsp;Just a fight well organized in manor, like how much rounds will be there, what attire should we wore, which style of fight, general rules to stay safe etc. you know!&rdquo; he clarified</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay. So what&rsquo;s your childhood dream my dear friend?&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked directly.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hmm but why are you asking all this?&rdquo; he said in slight naughty way</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Because that guy around you who likes to wrestle is me&rdquo;, I said with smile.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay&rdquo; he also smiled and started describing fight plan &ldquo;In our fight there will three rounds, each will only ends by another&rsquo;s total give up. First round will started by standing position only and in second round coin will tossed for upper position knee and palm start position and in third round the upper guy of second will go down.&rdquo; He explained.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay cool, but what about rules&rdquo; I asked.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;See buddy as this is friendly fight it should not be too rough so very simple rules will be there, no punches, no kicks, no elbow/knee hit, and no dirty tricks, and yeah anything else which can leave visible wounds is also not allowed&rdquo;, he explained.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Cool buddy, good idea, I think it will be just like submission wrestling, right?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You know about submission wrestling! Yeah it will exactly the same&rdquo; he said with happiness.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah obviously i know about it, but&hellip;&rdquo; I looked about our attire &ldquo;in this dress up! Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s too much for this kind of fight?&rdquo; we were in sweat pants and half sleeves top, so I asked.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah, but have I mentioned gears for the fight? No na, then keep quiet you dumb and listen me first.&rdquo; He said again in annoyed voice. &rdquo;We will do different level undress by each round ...&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Means?&rdquo; I asked curiously.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just keep your mouth shut for some time?&rdquo; Jaimin said angrily &ldquo;we will start the fight with just wearing on and bare-chested, then in second round we will up the dhotis and wear it like lungot and in third round we will be just in speedos. Howe&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said with smile and one eyebrow up.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Quite manly I must say, but how to arrange dhoti?&rdquo; I was confused. As dhotis are out fashioned and not available at our house.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;My mom&rsquo;s saris will be excellent dhoti for us&rdquo; he said and takes out two of it from wardrobe.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay, fine, where will we do all this?&rdquo; I asked as I start undressing and wearing dhoti.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Over here only&hellip;in this room. We will shut all the windows and doors and down the curtains&rdquo; he said.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>I looked around room, yeah baby; it&rsquo;s larger than my previous fight place also. And better as there were some cotton mattresses also on floor. So as soon as we both completed with dhoti I took a look at his bare-chested upper torso, it&rsquo;s not that bad as I expected, he was quite fit and looking very attractive in dhoti, he was also watching my body as if he was praising it, for me it was sexy moment after all my friend was quite fit but not as me so I had a brighter chance I thought.</p>
                    <p>Now we were all set to bang on the much awaited fight.</p>
                    <p>We came into center of the room from our sides and shake the hands and give each other a friendly hug as per tradition of kushti. And then we stood in wrestler&rsquo;s stand to start the fight.</p>
                    <p>We take circle around each other to get better position over other. After a moment we get that there is no chance to get upper hand in start so we just slapped our palms too gather and get the position of test of strength. Our arms were giving all the power to take upper hand and our biceps were showing their full strength. As I expected the kid was really strong and giving good fight.</p>
                    <p>Slowly and gradually we reached for upper arms of each other, our muscles were staring&hellip; when I dint find any chance to get suitable position I went for standing headlock, but Jaimin was clever also and grabbed me in his arm and we were&nbsp; in mutual standing headlock. Now I was putting all the pressure I had on his neck and he was doing the same, Jaimin weakened by headlock but he was a jerk kid&hellip; he was not ready to give-up. So I continued the pressure and somehow managed to get myself free from his headlock and went behind him keeping my arm locked around his neck. Now he was in my control.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Give up you punk, and accept that you had no dare to challenge me for fight&hellip;hahaha&rdquo; I said in taunting tone.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Arrrrghhhh, never. Give up? My foot&hellip; I will never give up to you and that too this early, there is lots of still in the bag for you my friend, just once let me out of this&hellip;&rdquo; and he jerked his body to get free but my hold was not that weak and by this move I applied more pressure, he was straining in my arm but was not ready to give-up</p>
                    <p>So I decided to show him what I got more and I slowly slipped my another hand under his arm and placed behind his neck and quickly done same with other hand took him in full nelson and started applying pressure on his neck again&hellip; all this continued for 3-4 minutes and during this we both get sweaty and slippery as well.</p>
                    <p>The clever kid took this opportunity and slide outside from my nelson and seated on the floor. He was all strained and breathing heavily to recover. But I dint give him chance for that, I quickly picked him up from behind and slipped both my arms around his slick waist. Now the fight was on the ground. I was on my back and face up and he was on me in face up position and having himself in my tight reverse bear hug. Slowly I moved up and slipped him underneath me so he just can&rsquo;t escape away.</p>
                    <p>But he was also tough guy and somehow managed to escape from me and this time he was quick as he grabbed me by waist and took me in frontal bear hug and started applying grapevine on me. I must admit that he was too good at it&hellip; for some time I was feeling as if I was in hug of python. Slowly and gradually I got success to make my hands free from his deadly grapevine and started to break his hold.</p>
                    <p>After 7-8 more minute I was out from his grapevine and quickly grabbed his head with my legs and applied leg scissor on him. I knew my legs are my biggest strength and I used it well also. His was face was started getting red and slowly blue. He was in intense pain.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Come on you jerk, give up now!&rdquo; I said furiously.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;No, not now you big guy!!!&rdquo; he said as he hit me in thighs, it was so intense that I trembled for moment and he escaped away from me again.</p>
                    <p>But I quickly recovered and again grabbed him in frontal bear hug but this time he managed to get his hands free but still he was in my hug but he also managed to make it mutual bear hug, now I had one arm over his shoulder and another one underneath it and he was also in same position.</p>
                    <p>Now we were in tight mutual bear hug. It was so intense that even air couldn&rsquo;t pass through us. But I knew bear hug is my forte so I should not leave this opportunity. So I continue with this all hold for 5 more minutes. During that we both increased our intensity in the fight. And we were literally exaggerated but no one wanted to give up&hellip;</p>
                    <p>at this time I remembered one thing and I started jerkin Jaimin and he loosened up and I took his both arms inside my hug and applied all the pressure I had for last time and&hellip; yeah round one&rsquo;s result is about to be declare.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Argh, Come on Give-up now you little boy, otherwise you will lost your life due&rdquo;, I just shouted furiously.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Aaaarrrrgggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh, oaky okay, I am giving, I am giving&rdquo; he said as he tapped me for three times.</p>
                    <p>And yeah the round one is over and proved my name right, I was ABHIJEET if literally translated to English then THE CONQUEROR, yeah I was CONQUEROR of mat for that time.</p>
                </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="jumbotron">
                <p>I let him go out of my hold and he just slide beside me and were both were breathing heavily and trying to recover for next round and then after some time we stood up and again hugged each other gently as signal of round ending.</p>
