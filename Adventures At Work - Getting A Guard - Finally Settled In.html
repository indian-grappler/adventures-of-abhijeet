                <p>As mentioned in previous chapter, I tested my initially appointed personal security chief was just a corrupted guy. Since then company C.S.O (Chief Security Officer) was taking charge of my personal security, but as he was C.S.O., it was sure he himself cannot be in charge for much time.</p>
                <p>So once all crackdown of corruption in security was done he appointed another hunk as my personal security lead and insisted that I do the same tests on him too so that we can be double sure. The new guy … contrary to previous one and it was quite pleasure to interview and test him on my personal basis.</p>

        <div class="container">

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>After I shared the &lsquo;results&rsquo; of Vikrant with Mr. Chauhan (C.S.O), he was totally surprised at the fiasco of Vikrant. According to him, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. Hence he assured me a detailed investigation and just within a week a massive security recruitment scam was uncovered within the company. The racket was running effortlessly since past 2-3 years and many underachievers have been recruited under elite security forces. (It was really a force &hellip; the strength of overall security team was over 300 personnel and 50 of them were serving as elite team which was mainly serving the top management. Elite team was supposed to match the skills of any established military teams as they were responsible to protect some of the most prominent personalities of company and state who were really big in state wide business and political circle.)</p>
                    <p>So taking strict actions, all of the responsible staff was fired on immediate basis and it was made sure that they don&rsquo;t get a job anywhere else. Some major corruption promoters have been sued legally by the company too. All that cleaning up the mess went for around a month and Mr. Chauhan was handling my personal security for that duration.</p>
                    <p>But as C.S.O. himself was leading my team, I was not allowed to go on fields myself as I cannot leave the office premises without security lead, and my security lead himself was bound to company headquarters due to obvious reasons.</p>
                    <p>So once all that cleaning up drama got over I took an appointment with him and went to his office on his provided time slot in evening. He greeted me with his signature smile and told me to have a seat.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So son, what can I do for you?&rdquo; He asked warmly.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Umm, uncle as you are not able to provide time to come with me on field visits of our construction site which completely understandable as you are a chief &hellip; how about you appoint someone else as my security lead? I mean it&rsquo;s more than month since I joined the company and I still didn&rsquo;t got a chance to visit any of our sites since as per His Highness&rsquo;s (we still address my father as his highness in official conversation, as he is still ceremonial king of ex royal state) order I cannot leave headquarters without full security team. As the mess cleaning of security is almost done too, I think it&rsquo;s good time that you appoint a personal lead for me I guess.&rdquo; I said in polite manner.</p>
                    <p>He gave a thoughtful expression to me said, &ldquo;Yes son, I was also thinking the same. In fact I was planning to appoint a new lead in couple of days, actually I have one guy in my mind &hellip;&rdquo; he said and turned his laptop towards me with that guy&rsquo;s profile open and continue &ldquo;This is Mr. Lakshya Singh Sisodia, a young, charismatic and very friendly person I know personally since few years and newly recruited in our force. The guy is very reliable, skilled, humble and down to earth, trained under my very good friend&rsquo;s personal supervision who happened to be my colleague in armed forces, I think you know him &hellip; Mr. Amar Singh Sisodia. The good thing is there is no scope we would be in blind like we were in case of Vikrant. Further he belongs to sound family and want to do job just for his self-satisfaction, so there is almost nil chance that he will do corruption in future too.&rdquo; He said in proud manner and added &ldquo;Further he is distant cousin and very good friend of Advait &hellip; in fact Advait himself proposed him to be your personal security lead.&rdquo; with a smile.</p>
                    <p>Recommendation of Advait! Really! Oh gosh, he is my favorite sparring partner since childhood training and a very good friend till date! Very strong, rough and rowdy in training pit yet equally pleasant guy to be with off the pit! He is couple of years elder to me and I trust every person whom he trust, as since childhood he was very good at evaluating people and people who are around him has to be best! I was just convinced about Lakshya by mention of Advait!</p>
                    <p>Then C.S.O. said further &ldquo;I still want you to be double sure, may be you would be interested in conducting some tests with him like you did with Vikrant?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Uncle, I am just convinced about him if he is son of Amar uncle and friend of Advait! No need to test!&rdquo; I said innocently.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I insist you do, at least you guys will learn few things from each other and as you enjoy combat sports, he can be your future sparring partner! So just go ahead and have an introduction in Rajputana way!&rdquo; He said cheerfully.</p>
                    <p>Then it clicked me, &ldquo;Sure uncle!&rdquo; I said with smile and added &ldquo;So may I take your leave?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure boy! Have my best wishes for you!&rdquo; He said with warm smile.</p>

                    <p>I was all excited about the new appointment to my personal security team and was giggling inside about him. By first look only I was very much attracted to Lakshya and having recommendation of Advait added a cherry on the cake!</p>
                    <p>Lakshya was looking very warm and friendly in his portfolio picture. His on paper stats were suggesting he is exact same match for me as a sparring partner &hellip; 6&rsquo; height, 80Kg (176lbs) weight, well built and trained in similar way and techniques like I was. Sharp facial features with strong jaw line, light whitish smooth skin with glow, sexy brown eyes, mid cut dark brown hair, warm smile and friendly body language were creating thunders in my heart!</p>
                    <p>If he is recommended by my most reliable friend as my guard then he must be tough shit skilled guy &hellip; no doubt in that &hellip; but I was no pushover too! Further I never imagined myself in plain erotic romance like most bisexual or homosexual guys do, I was always aroused by the guys who can fight me well, and if you are able to defeat me in fair way &hellip; then I am all yours!</p>
                    <p>So all in all he was just not a perfect guard to my body, but if he goes on same note as me then he would guard my secrets and fantasies well too! Now my heart would know no limits to pump excitement if Lakshya too would in same things as I was or at least do not have objection over my THAT part!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>As soon as I reached home, I dialed the number of Advait to have a talk about his recommendation &hellip; Lakshya. Advait is one of the very few guys who knows about all of my sides including my Bi-Sexuality, so after having some casual chitchat and some general talk about Lakshya, I asked him blatantly about what can I expect from Lakshya for my PERSONAL treatment, and he just said that there is hope for me and I don&rsquo;t need to be shy about it &hellip; though put that carefully in front of him as he is quite professional towards his job and like to keep bed and desk separate. WOW!</p>
                    <p>I hardly slept that night as my mind was all engaged in that beautiful smile of Lakshya and his eyes &hellip; they were so spellbinding! Anyways, I have to get up early in the morning as usual so that I don&rsquo;t miss morning workout and also don&rsquo;t get late at work. As a future successor of company&rsquo;s chairman position, I wanted to set an example of professionalism and punctuality in the office, so being late at work even by a minute for even a day had no scope in my routine.</p>
                    <p>In fact that day I winded up my morning schedule much earlier than usual, after all the sooner I reach the office the earlier I get to meet Lakshya for the first time! Further it was a Friday, a last working day of the week, so with all that childlike excitement I reached office while literally jumping at some points when no one was around. The first thing I done after getting in was calling my assistant to send Lakshya to my cabin on ASAP basis.</p>
                    <p>It took just 5 minutes before I heard a gentle knock on my cabin door and I told to come in &hellip; and there he stood &hellip; Lakshya &hellip; the would be chief of my personal security &hellip; and &hellip; and &hellip; well possibilities are endless peeps! He was looking absolutely dapper in standard security get up of black slacks, white shirt and black tie with tight black blazer on it and all of that were sticking to his physic like a second skin!</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Good Morning, Your Royal Highness!&rdquo; He greeted with warm, soothing and clam voice by the time he reach to table and stood straight with hands locked at his back.</p>
                    <p>WTF! He was at another pole in comparison to Vikrant! He did had respect for me and knew how exactly to behave with your future employers! Further he addressed me by my ceremonial title! It was so sexy to hear that from his sexy juicy lips!</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Good Morning &hellip;&rdquo; I replied with horny as fuck voice and was staring him like a hungry wolf eyeing his prey! I was so lost in him for couple of seconds that when I tried to grab cup of coffee, I accidentally dip my hand in piping hot coffee! It threw me back to reality in very hard way and I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself to let out light scream &ldquo;OOOUUUCCCCHHH&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Are you okay your highness?&rdquo; He said with real sense of worry while coming near to me and leaning over.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; yes &hellip;&rdquo; I said still in pain of burn but I needed to be in composure anyhow so I added &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing major, I was just in some other thoughts. You can take a seat by the way.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I hope it gets healed soon your highness.&rdquo; He said still in concern and took a seat across the table.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s very mild burn, will get recovered soon.&rdquo; I said in assuring voice and added, &ldquo;Please do not address me by &lsquo;Your Highness&rsquo;, you can simply address me as Abhijeet, Abhi or max to max Mr. Jadeja. Nobody address me by ceremonial title here.&rdquo; I said in frank manner.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay sure your highness &hellip;&rdquo; he said and crushed his tongue lightly between teeth (that was cute!) and said &ldquo;Sorry, Mr. Jadeja. Please tell me how can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I would prefer Abhijeet as we are almost of same age.&rdquo; I replied with smile and added &ldquo;Before we go ahead, I would like to discuss some points about my regular routine and my way to work which includes lot of field visits, so that you can have better idea about arrangements of my moving.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Of course Mr. Jadeja &hellip;&rdquo; again crushed tongue lightly and said &ldquo;Sorry, Abhijeet. That&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Then I put forth all of the scenarios which came to my mind at that time, just like I did with Vikrant. But here the stark difference was that Lakshya was answering and discussing each and every thing very sincerely and elaborating his strategy where I was getting doubtful. It was really very pleasurable to have that much long discussion with him. He had a skill to engage someone on the same line as he wanted and that was one important quality if you are supposed to deal with kind of pseudo well-wishers of labor class present on the fields.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well Lakshya, it was really a pleasure meeting with you and one last thing &hellip;&rdquo; I almost concluded the meeting and added &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you &nbsp;have been told or not, but before your final appointment I would like to take some personal tests in privacy, and you will only get confirmation if you go through those tests. So, do you have any problem with that?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;No, no problem at all. Mr. Chauhan did tell me some sort of thing. I am confident &hellip; and up for anything you suggest. Just tell me where and when these tests would be held.&rdquo; He said with confident smile.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, I would like to meet you at Royal Gymnasium, tonight at 10 for that. Is that okay with you?&rdquo; I said pretending to be professional outside.</p>
                    <p>He smiled lightly and said &ldquo;Okay sure thing, after all I like tests very much!&rdquo; and winked.</p>
                    <p>Then I stood up and he followed that, then I went near to him and offered my hand for handshake and said &ldquo;So tonight is a decision time buddy!&rdquo; and took him in light professional hug.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure Abhijeet!&rdquo; he hugged back and murmured near to my ear and left.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>I was having butterflies in my stomach throughout the day like I was supposed to meet my teenage crush for the first time! That reaction was very well justified as I was going to enjoy my favorite sport with a guy who is incredibly gorgeous, hunk, very tough and most probably is on same page as me in sexual terms. Possibilities were HUGE!</p>
                    <p>I was not able to concentrate on work for the rest of day, which was easily sensed by dad. Well, being understanding father and boss, he did not asked much questions and released me from work day on exact End of Day time and I bolted myself out of office straight heading to home. Once home I had relatively early dinner and after some mild walk I called Advait to discuss the today&rsquo;s happenings with Lakshya and what I was planning for tonight. I don&rsquo;t know why but it was clear that he was trying hard to stop his laugh!</p>
                    <p>At the end, I finally asked with annoyance &ldquo;Why the hell you are laughing inside! What&rsquo;s so funny in that!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, you are in trouble buddy!&rdquo; Advait said hardly restrain his laugh while talking &ldquo;Be ready to get your ass kicked in case you are planning to have a match!&rdquo; and finally laughed like he is rolling on floor!</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hey hey hey! I am not a child &hellip; Okay! I do have my own stand in fights and I am confident about taking him on! Come on dude!&rdquo; I said with snobbish childlike attitude.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You &hellip; you &hellip; you will find out very soon brother &hellip; very &hellip; very soon!&rdquo; he said in between his laughs.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Whatever &hellip;&rdquo; and I cut the call in annoyance.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, I was confident about my stand against Lakshya, at least until that point, but now I was thinking about grappling match part seriously, especially after mockery of Advait. He is not a guy who would mock me without reason &hellip; so then I thought that I better need to concentrate on the prime event of today&rsquo;s meeting with pretty boy body guard &hellip; FIGHT! Yes, I like him and was aroused - attracted, but there is no way I can allow him to manhandle me &hellip; for me winning in man on man combat is far more important than banging some ass!</p>
                    <p>Now I switched on my full devil fighter mode and threw out any erotic thought I had in my mind about Lakshya and started to assess him as pure opponent mentally. He was surely an exact match in stats but was trained more elaborately in combat sports than me. So I have to be prepared for a very long and tough fight tonight.</p>
                    <p>I glanced at my wrist watch and it was around 8, I still had good 2 hours as the place, Royal Gymnasium, was basically one expanded wing of our palace bungalow facing the road. It was basically a small and kind of personal gymnasium facility dedicated for our family and friends and it usually gets fully empty by 9.Thoguh it was just for very limited usage and small building but still it was very recognizable as it was linked to palace premises. I had the keys with which I can close facility from inside too. Further I just need to cross the garden to get there.</p>
                    <p>As I had quite good time on hand, I decided to spend that time in gymnasium itself to do some warmup and light strength exercise. So I returned to my room changed to very short black performance shorts and a matching performance tank top. Then I headed to gymnasium building which was fully empty as expected being a week day. Once there I started cardio workout to warmup myself which followed by some mid weight bench press and other free weights so that I can get pumped for action and do not get too exhausted or tired at the same time.</p>
                    <p>After going through all that exercise when I glanced over the clock, it was almost 9:30, I didn&rsquo;t realized where the time flew away! Anyways, I still had half an hour so I decided to take a shower so that my muscles can get relaxed and soothed for upcoming action. As I used to keep some extra pairs of clothes in gymnasium, changing was not big issue as well. So I then took a shower and wore loose shorts with tight white boxer briefs inside and a sexy fitting white tank top showing off my well-developed shoulders, biceps and upper back.</p>
                    <p>I was all pumped and fresh, mentally and physically both. At that time I was concentrating on action more than other aspects of upcoming confrontation. By the time I was all ready to get on the mats with my hot opponent, it was almost 9:50 PM, so I was expecting Lakshya to be there at any moment and I sat down beside a window facing road side parking and within few minutes I saw a Royal Enfield entering in a lot, I could only recognize a rider to be Lakshya when he pulled up just beside a window I was sitting &hellip; he was looking absolutely stunning in grey performance tracks and blue wife beaters.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>He gave me sincere but mischievous smile while parking his RE and killing the engine. Without any word he headed towards the main entrance of gymnasium carrying a small duffle bag with him, so I too headed towards that direction and opened the main door to welcome him &hellip; and there he stood &hellip; looking absolutely intimidating with broad and well developed torso and ripped as fuck biceps with absolutely stunning and defined male cleavage hinting towards well developed chest. I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself to stare at him in awe and he too gave me an appreciative stare in response.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So wouldn&rsquo;t you welcome a guest in your gymnasium your royal highness?&rdquo; he finally uttered in low pitch voice with a naughty smile and took duffle bag on his shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure Mr. Sisodia, please welcome! Test time is almost there!&rdquo; I replied with same kind of smile as him while giving welcoming gesture.</p>
                    <p>Once he entered in gymnasium, I carefully locked the main entrance so that no one can interrupt us without intimation or as a surprise. Then I led him to main sitting area of my small personal gymnasium which had just two two-seat sofas across a small table. We took seats at opposite sofas facing each other and I offered him a glass of water from the water bottle on table.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So Abhijeet, what kind of tests you want to conduct tonight?&rdquo; he asked after gulping down water.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Nothing serious dude. Just one basic practical test &hellip; that is one on one tackles.&rdquo; I purposefully gave just a hint instead of elaborating the full thing.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;And what exactly would be in that?&rdquo; he asked with raised eyebrow and a smile. I was sure he was just pretending to be oblivion.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, I was thinking about a submission grappling &hellip; best of 3 or 5 may be?&rdquo; I finally said without playing around much.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. How about we don&rsquo;t limit count? That way we will get rid of keeping score and winner can be decided by exhaustion, this way you can get full demonstration of my stamina, match can stretched as I really like long matches and most importantly we can afford it tonight as we have full night and its Friday night, so it must be a BANG!&rdquo; he said enthusiastically (bit over enthusiastically I must say).</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;BANG!&rdquo; I was seriously baffled so took a pause and added &ldquo;Pardon! What did you meant by that?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>He cleared his throat and said &ldquo;Nothing Abhijeet, I was just trying to say that submission grappling is my favorite sport too and I heard from Advait that you are also good at it, so it would be a very good match between us if we have exhaustion rule match.&rdquo; And poured him another glass of water and gulped it.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I hope it will and exhaustion rule sounds good.&rdquo; I replied with naughty smile while gulping some water directly from water bottle.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Surely it will, I promise about it.&rdquo; He said with sincere yet challenging stare into my eyes and continued &ldquo;So, where this test is supposed to be held?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I too gave him same kind of stare and said &ldquo;We have a mid-sized mat room with changing room there, which would be good enough according to me.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>On that note he stood up and said with while stretching his arms back with picking up his duffle bag &ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I too followed his suite and stood up then said &ldquo;Then what are we waiting for! Let&rsquo;s start your test Mr. Sisodia!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure thing your royal highness, please lead.&rdquo; He said while gesturing me to go ahead.</p>
                    <p>Then I went straight to mat room and turned on the lights and when he too entered the room I locked the door from inside. As soon as we get in the room he gently put the duffle bag beside the door and started to assess the room and surroundings. The room was specially designed to practice various hand to hand combat sports with wall to wall mats and a wall fully covered with mirrors just opposite to entrance to the room. It also had two dedicated changing rooms on opposite walls other than mirrored wall and wall with door and ventilation fan. &nbsp;It was not as big as Vijay&rsquo;s Gym&rsquo;s Aerobics Hall if you remember that from previous series (Earning The Post &ndash; Chapter 2: Battle Of Titans), but it was not small either &hellip; in short it was around 20 x 20 feet wide and fully covered with mats making it a perfect place for private matches like tonight &hellip; not too big and not too small either.</p>
                    <p>So once I locked the room we met at the center of the room to face each other in challenging tone &hellip; staring and assessing each other for upcoming action.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So, shall we start?&rdquo; he said almost in hissing tone.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure &hellip; but don&rsquo;t you think we have bit too much clothes for a wrestling match?&rdquo; I said like genuine concern.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yes, we have &hellip;&rdquo; he said with innocent smile while taking one step back and continued &ldquo;I too thought the same but then I didn&rsquo;t said that as I thought you would not be comfortable for that.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Why on earth I won&rsquo;t be comfortable! I am a combat sport athlete just like you, I don&rsquo;t shy away from skin!&rdquo; I said in genuine surprised tone over his comment.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! I generally grapple in just tight boxer briefs &hellip; is that okay?&rdquo; he said bit hesitantly.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Perfect! That&rsquo;s my favorite attire for grappling too!&rdquo; I said with friendly smile to make him bit easy and added &ldquo;As I said, this room have two separate changing rooms, so you can change here itself or can use one of those changing rooms if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I already have boxer briefs beneath the tracks, so I just need to strip off these tracks and top. If you don&rsquo;t mind I would like to that in corner itself.&rdquo; he said with somewhat eased up smile.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well perfect! Even I have the same case, let&rsquo;s save the time and change here itself.&rdquo; I said with cheerful voice.</p>
                    <p>Then we went to opposite diagonal corners and mutually stripped our tops and took some moments to assess and appreciate each other&rsquo;s well developed torso. It was the first instance I saw Lakshya&rsquo;s bare torso and man! He was visibly tough shit guy with very well defined chest and had washboard abs to die for! He also gave me full length glance and gave somewhat appreciative expression on his face. Then again we mutually lowered down our bottoms and slowly pushed it all the way down and came out the bottoms and again I was just in awe of his developed leg muscles and so he was in mine. He was looking absolutely stunning just in his black boxer briefs, and I too was in very good shape &hellip; almost matching his ripped physic. The deciding factor tonight was purely skills &hellip; and it was clear that this fight is going to be the one of most memorable one for me!</p>
                    <p>Then we also got read off from our footwear headed towards each other to meet in center and there we stood toe to toe having that &lsquo;no shit &hellip; just business&rsquo; look on our face. We were so close that we could actually feel the body heat radiating from another body and our chest and face were barely few millimeters apart.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So let&rsquo;s get started Abhi!&rdquo; he said and forwarded hand for a friendly handshake.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started buddy!&rdquo; I replied and shook hands with him in friendly manner and we took a step back to start the action.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Now we were all set to start the action and started to circle each other &hellip; we both were at equal energy level. For quite some time we just kept pushing each other with occasional attempt of lock so that we can assess each other&rsquo;s strength and move ahead accordingly. We continued that circling and light hustle for next few minutes and we also kept searching for any solid move to have proper advantage on another.</p>
                    <p>As even after few minutes we didn&rsquo;t get any advantageous position we eventually grabbed each other&rsquo;s neck in a clean move from that hustling and got locked in firm collar-elbow move and started to pulling each other down to ground so that we can gain some sort of upper hand. All that events were done in very energetic way and with clean and neat moves so far but as we were complete match, it was difficult for both of us to gain some advantage easily.</p>
                    <p>We were now pushing and pulling each other in somewhat fierce manner, but still it was almost a status quo and action was not moving ahead and I was thinking to demonstrate some surprise move &hellip; but &hellip; then I got surprise before I can think about my one &hellip; In one swift way he suddenly left his lock and slide both of his hands under my arms &hellip; came extremely near to me &hellip; tangled his leg between me and threw me to mats by forcefully motioning my body to ground and once I was on ground he quickly side mounted me with my one arm between his thighs and clenching my neck tightly with one arm and securing my free arm with his one.</p>
                    <p>He was on me at 90 degree chest to chest and basically both of arms were locked and his whole body was out of reach from my winning weapon &hellip; my thighs! Man! He was really had quite shrewd skills! It wasn&rsquo;t that he just knew attacking skills, but also very well aware of defense and preventing attack in first place! His grip on my head was tight and I was getting suffocated badly in that squeeze. I was continuously trying to get out of that situation and be in at least better position.</p>
                    <p>It went like that for around next 5-6 minutes, but they were longest 5-6 minutes I have ever experienced. It seemed longer than the really long holds I have been in before and in some which I lost the match too. But this was totally on different level and most exhausting thing I have ever been in!</p>
                    <p>After too much struggle we both were sweating heavily now, and by the time passed I also managed to get some better position by forcing him to let go my arm and face me face to face. Though my head was still in his grip but at least now I had better body movement. I tried to take advantage of that and rolled us such that he came beneath me with my head still in his grip.</p>
                    <p>I expected that this roll over will get me some good advantage &hellip; but this man with fucking expert skills took it for his advantage and secured a closed guard on me! Again not to forget that even with this movement he still had my head in grip, but after that much time of exhaustion even I was pushing my limits and had a leverage of my increased testosterone level. With that rush I applied all the might I had in my arms on his grip and finally got out of his anaconda arms after almost 15 long minutes!</p>
                    <p>Though he had guard on me and was way skilled then my prior opponents, I was no patsy guy too. Even with his guard and relatively fresh state, I managed to prevent him from applying any new awkward position on me and thus took some time to breathe deeply after that suffocating lock on my neck!</p>
                    <p>I glanced over his eyes in a desperate way and to my surprise he too was looking at me but had completely neutral expression! He didn&rsquo;t have any emotion that we generally feel in fights &hellip; there was no sign of furiousness ... attitude &hellip; tease &hellip; confident &hellip; winning &hellip; nothing! HE WAS COMPLETELY NEUTRAL &hellip; not a dead expression &hellip; just neutral!</p>
                    <p>It gave me some odd comfort and relaxed me and I was all set to take this purely competitive and not on personal level. So going ahead I started to apply my skills which were unused since almost half a decade. Combat sports were like eating and breathing for me &hellip; I can never get UNSKILLED in it. So from that point the real competitive fight picked up a pace.</p>
                    <p>I somehow got out from that guard and moving ahead we spent almost couple of hours in that friendly but intense action with absolute competiveness. During that whole time there were lots of action with very intense holds like leg figure four, lots of sleepers, scissors chokes, pins, pulls from both sides with occasional standing fight of hustle and tussle and all in all no one was winning in first one and half hour and the match was very very energetic with speedy movements and holds applied one after another in instant manner, at one moment I would be in hold and at another situation would get flipped. But since last half an hour I was losing my stamina and was becoming exhausted by every passing minute.</p>
                    <p>Due to very long duration of continued highly energetic action we both were sweating profusely and our bodies were quite heated too. Due to that after those intense hours the match was now in somewhat in slow pace and mostly stuck to ground. I was all exhausted but Lakshya still had good stamina, so now I was losing grip on the match and I started to get in his strong and intense holds for longer duration than before. In one such hold we became chest to chest with both us on our sides again and due to ultimate exhaustion my resistance was quite low but I prevent roll and I just wanted to extend the fight now because I hate giving up!</p>
                    <p>As the fight was now in slow mode I was &hellip; rather say we were now able to explore more possibilities on other aspects of fight &hellip; and I have been notorious with provoking or at least coming on THAT point. So as our bodies were all sweat covered with intense hold in slow struggle against each other&rsquo;s skin, it strike me to explore THOSE possibilities, but&nbsp; I wanted to play safe and wanted to check whether this can really lead to notorious things or not.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>So keeping the fight spirit I started gave him mild rub to his crotch with mine &hellip; pretending it&rsquo;s my movement to get out of hold &hellip; but there was no effect in first couple of times and I was losing hope but suddenly during my third try I sensed a light movement on other side though it was really mild but he also showed other symptoms of sexual stimulation like trying to close eyes in pleasure and tightening of nipples. So going ahead, I started bit more profound attempts and soon I was able to feel a full-fledged hard on from him and I was also fully aroused too by feeling his enormous package against mine.</p>
                    <p>I can&rsquo;t predict the correct size at that time but it was clear that it was largest I would have ever came across! Till that time I was the largest by either length or breadth or both, but by feel he must be slightly bigger if not having a major difference &hellip; and like any alpha male would felt &hellip; I was disappointed by that possibility! I just didn&rsquo;t like the idea of mine to be smaller than the other man!</p>
                    <p>Anyways, I was anyhow getting convinced with that after every passing minute and even with my teasing and his own erection he was still having full grip on fight like it was his basic habit like breathing! Even with full erection he was still dominating me completely and frankly his ferocity has been increased then before! So, now as action was not showing any effect I decided to add words in it to divert him and try to explore any chance of getting upper hand in fight by doing that.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It looks like someone has got a good chunk of meet down there! What&rsquo;s happening stud?&rdquo; I said with bit sexually provocative voice and winked with giving even tighter rub to his crotch to which his tool reacted more actively and now it was hard like rock.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Aahh, so I was correct &hellip; it was intentional, isn&rsquo;t it! Well to be clear it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;someone&rsquo; but it should be &lsquo;some-two&rsquo;&rdquo; he replied &ldquo;Looks like someone else is also having bit smaller but hard meet too&rdquo; he added in seductive but provocative voice while tighten his grip at the same time.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;What! Small! Definitely NO! How about we decide that by direct comparision?&rdquo; I replied in mixed tone of annoyance and seduction.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hold for it SIR! I would love that and if you are ready then much more &hellip;&rdquo; he again gave wave of tight grip and continued &ldquo;BUT first let&rsquo;s just wind this mess up, after all I would like to clear the test first before doing anything ecstatic!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;How you are so confident about you clearing a test, I am nowhere near to giving up!&rdquo; I said with attitude and tried not so enough attempt to get move out of him, though somewhere inside I knew he is going to have that but then I added with my evil smile &ldquo;And does that implies that these results would be directly linked to upcoming action?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>In reply with a powerful motion he got mounted on me and replied &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke Abhi! I am definitely going to win, now it&rsquo;s clearly all about how long you can take punishment!&rdquo; and again gave a wave of tighten grip and added &ldquo;And as far as linking the result of this and that action &hellip; well I was not thinking on that track, but I can think about it if it that was you first idea.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You mean you were not thinking about that in first place!&rdquo; I said surprisingly.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Thinking about what? Making out or linking it with fight results?&rdquo; He said in clear and bold manner.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;About both &hellip;&rdquo; I replied still in surprise.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, I have predicted making out with you &hellip; I mean come on! I am not blind! The way you gave a luscious stare in morning, I was thinking you were going to gulp me then and there!&rdquo; he said in genuine laugh and added &ldquo;And about linking those both action, well &hellip; hell no! Intercourse is worship for me and linking it with outcome with fight has high chance that the one on losing end might not enjoy the experience!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Wow, I am impressed with you BEAST!&rdquo; I said with genuine sense of appreciation and suddenly I noticed his first half of his reply so I added &ldquo;Wait! What! You knew that I am horny about you and you still agreed to meet me at night!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yes, as I said it was obvious, even a fool can say that. It&rsquo;s just I was not expecting that tonight itself!&rdquo; He replied in mild smile and added &ldquo;The reason I agreed to meet was &hellip; I genuinely believed that you were calling me for this action being a professional man. I am aware with what has happen in company during last couple of months and I also know how the whole scam was uncovered, I know what you did with that motherfucker Vikrant and thought you wanted to test me in same way!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Though he appreciated me but I felt that by the sexual provocation I have let him down and as he was honest with me, I too decided to be on clear note with him so I replied &ldquo;So, basically I have let you down by provoking you &hellip; right?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>In reply he laughed hardly and said &ldquo;Hell No!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Then!?&rdquo; I was again baffled.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I will explain all that shit &hellip;&rdquo; he said while applying tight grapevine on me and added &ldquo;But first let me just PASS my test!&rdquo; then applied even more pressure in his grapevine.</p>
                    <p>Feeling the dedication from his side, I too continued the fight without more tries of trash talk or tease and continued my attempts to move out of his tight locked position. After some tries I was able to come out from his highly sexually oriented lock but as I said earlier &hellip; I was on verge of total exhaustion while he still had very much stamina intact, so again he got me in leg figure four instantly on my waist and started apply fierce force there.</p>
                    <p>By the time passed on one hand his holds were getting more and more intense and on second I was constantly losing my stamina and energy to keep fighting. Anyways, I was just not a fierce offensive fighter, but I was also a sturdy and stubborn guy who can take insane amount of punishment before giving up!</p>
                    <p>So all that action got even more stretched for around a hour more in which I went through more and more intense, fierce and insane moves from Lakshya who were absolutely dedicated to achieve his &lsquo;LAKSHYA&rsquo; (Lakshya &ndash; its Sanskrit origin word of Hindi which means &lsquo;Aim&rsquo; or &lsquo;Goal&rsquo;). He was applying one after another hold me continuously &hellip; throughout that hour he thrashed me absolutely like a rag doll. He was clearly and completely dominating me thoroughly now! Back in mind I had impression that he has moved out of the erection part but when he came face to face for couple of time I realized that he still had a full hard on and damn hard nipples!</p>
                    <p>Man! It was commendable that even with that much aroused state he was just concentrating on fight and never done teasing to me! No doubt he had a great self-control on him and was really able to keep his emotions content as per his own will and nothing can affect his ongoing job!</p>
                    <p>Now I was just not on verge of total exhaustion, I was in fact exhausted totally after three long hours of intense action. At one point he flipped me to face ground and applied a tight rear naked choke on me with his full body weight on back. It was so deadly that it had totally cut down the air flow to my brain and just in few seconds I was all dizzy and things were turning dark in front of my eyes &hellip; I was about to pass out &hellip; and &hellip; and I finally tapped out on his shoulder and he instantly released his choke and I took a deep breath to gain my senses back.</p>
                    <p>After almost two hours of same leveled fight and one hour of taking one sided hard punishment, it was finally over &hellip; finally just before a second of passing out it was all over and Lakshya achieved what he wanted. He proved himself right for this job and also proved his abilities and made me sure that my security is in right hands.</p>
                </div>

        <div class="container">

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>After my submission no one of us moved for some moments &hellip; I was taking deep breathes to regain my senses and recover my energy, as the same time he was also breathing heavy to recover his own energy and absorbing his right full dominating victory. We both just didn&rsquo;t moved even an inch for few more moments and were lost in our recovery from the fierce action we just went through.</p>
                    <p>So, once we both recovered a bit from tiring and exhaustive action, we both were feeling very delighted for our individual reasons &hellip; he for achieving his victory &hellip; and I for &lsquo;Finally Settled In&rsquo; with my guard and the feeling of getting a correct guy for job. There was one common reason too, which I actually came to know later that it was common &hellip; and it was &hellip; getting a fantastic sparring and more importantly a BED mate for future.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, we still were in same position in which I submitted &hellip; I am facing ground and he being fully on my back. So, as now the combat action was ended, it was time to move on to the other and more pleasurable ACTION and he took initiative for that.</p>
                    <p>He started to rub his rock hard tool on my tight ass crack and caressing &hellip; rather say massaging my upper back through shoulders, bring his face near to my ear and murmured &ldquo;So, now as I have passed my exam &hellip; can I get some kind of reward?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;As far as I know &hellip; someone has said that fight match should not get linked with mating &hellip; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I said with aroused stammer. His breath on my ears and strong hands massaging my sweet spots around upper back and neck was making me mad &hellip; he was just as good in sexual acts as he is in fights! Just first stroke of his moves were making me insane!</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask for dominating half in this Abhi &hellip; I just asked some kind of small gift on my achievement &hellip; after you are one really tough guy &hellip; to be very frank a toughest guy I have ever fought &hellip; a very skilled, very strong and very competitive man you are! So it should definitely be counted as my major achievement &hellip; so don&rsquo;t you think I deserve a gift for that?&rdquo; He said in seductive voice while rubbing his cheek on my one and traversing his massaging hands around my waist taking me in intense romantic hug from back and gave most intense kiss on my neck I have ever experienced.</p>
                    <p>I got speechless for some seconds and was just enjoying his absolutely master moves. I was just thinking in my mind that if his lips felt so good on neck &hellip; how the hell good will they be on lips!</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, I would take it as compliment buddy!&rdquo; I replied with smile and flipped myself to face him and hugged him back grabbing him my embrace and continued in his ears &ldquo;Say &hellip; what you want as a gift beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>On that he shot his head back to face me and said with wicked face &ldquo;Beautiful! Eh! You are very confusing man! You love confusions or what? Sometime you get confused &hellip; and some other time you confuse others &hellip; like just tonight &hellip; you called me a beast earlier and now a beautiful! DAMN CONFUSING!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, you were beast at that time &hellip; completely dominating &hellip; and now you are gentle so &hellip; a beautiful.&rdquo; I said with broad smile and blush.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Awww &hellip; then you will soon address me KAMADEVA (A Hindu mythological god of love and sex &ndash; you can say a &lsquo;Cupid of Hinduism&rsquo;) for sure!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay! I will decide that later when I will experience that Mr. Beautiful!&rdquo; I said seductively and winked then added &ldquo;By the way, what other kind of confusions you were talking about? And more important &hellip; what you want as a gift?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Then he got off of me and laid on his side besides me, resting his head on his side arm and caressing my torso with finger of other arm and said softly &ldquo;During a match you were confused that you have done something wrong or you made me disappointed &hellip;&rdquo; and then added in even more seductive voice &ldquo;And as a gift &hellip; I would like to have upcoming full weekend with you at my farm house up in the hills &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>On that I blushed like a small baby boy and said &ldquo;You got your gift &hellip; &rdquo; and then added &ldquo;Well, I am still in that dilemma, as you said you were not expecting this, you genuinely thought about action test &hellip; and during that I teased &hellip; or say provoked your senses &hellip; so I genuinely wanted to know your side on that.&rdquo; I said in sincere voice.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, in that case &hellip; it&rsquo;s true that I was not expecting this tonight, but I was expecting this in future anyhow &hellip; your first look made it clear &hellip; crystal clear &hellip; and I didn&rsquo;t had any problem with that &hellip; I was aware about your interests and they were perfectly aligned with me.&rdquo; He said in as sincere voice while looking deeply in my eyes and continued &ldquo;And frankly I would have been disappointed by your move if you were not a good fighter. But as you put up a damn hard fight and was able to take much more punishment then I have expected &hellip; you are damn tough and skilled fighter &hellip; so I don&rsquo;t have any complaints about that &hellip; you fought well &hellip; were true to your sport &hellip; I felt it clearly &hellip; hence I don&rsquo;t have any complaint. You earned my respect as a fighter, so I can definitely deal with your sense of mixing up fight and mating &hellip; its new aspect for me but I can definitely explore that with you &hellip; GLADLY!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I was just mesmerized by his gentleman attitude, his ability to keep things separated and ultimate professionalism. I just didn&rsquo;t have any word to speak so we just kept staring into each other&rsquo;s eyes for what it felt like eternal. Then after sometime he said in very low and seductive voice &hellip;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;If we talk about making out &hellip; then let tell you that, in fact I wanted to get indulge with you way before you noticed me, but I was skeptical whether you will accept me in that way or not. So, I am extremely happy that you are just as into me as I am into you. Let me accept here &hellip; You were my crush the day I saw you at royal gathering his highness held on your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday! You were looking absolutely stunning and hunk in your ceremonial royal outfit. You were looking classy, dapper, cute, hunk, handsome, tough &hellip; all at the same time! You were really my love at first sight!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Wow! How the hell I didn&rsquo;t noticed him before! If he was present in that gathering then he must be in constant touch of my family &hellip; and still I didn&rsquo;t noticed him &hellip; shame on me! Anyway it was better late than never, so I decided play it bold now.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So Mr. Lakshya &hellip; As we are clear about almost all things now and as I want you as much as you want me &hellip; how about we let all breaks loose now?&rdquo; I said while moving on my side to face him and caressing his waist with my fingers &hellip;</p>
                    <p>The after some moments of unspoken lustful glance over each other&rsquo;s sexy sweaty bodies we slowly brought our face near to other and locked our lips in passionate smooch and we let loose our tongues to wrestle with other like our bodies were doing few moments ago. We took each other in tight passionate embrace and rolled over on mats multiple times while having passionate smooch and frottage at same time.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So &hellip; My lucky charm &hellip; you have passed a lip test too &hellip;&rdquo; I said in seductive voice after a long passionate smooch and frottage and then continued &ldquo;What other moves you have in your bag?&rdquo; said with wink.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;How about I show them while cleaning you under soothing cool water shower?&rdquo; he replied in low pitched seductive hissing &hellip;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure &hellip;&rdquo; that all I managed to utter out.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>On that note we both got up from mats and headed to one of two bathrooms we had in that room and stood under shower to experience the other kind of action moves. The first thing I was eager about was getting read of the only cloth we had between us &hellip; the boxer briefs. I was just about to remove it hurriedly but Lakshya stopped me and started to cares my neck with his lips and then guided them slowly to my waist &hellip; and then slowly lowered the waist of my briefs and gave hard lip massage to my upper pubs and eventually removed the briefs slowly and gradually like a pro! Learning from him I followed the suit and uncovered his treasure in the same way &hellip; I predicted it correct &hellip; he was around half an inch longer and lot thicker &hellip; against general Indian guys having a jungle down there &hellip; he was all clean and sexily smooth shaved!</p>
                    <p>The child water was flowing constantly on our bodies and providing excellent complement to our hot action including long lip locks &hellip; manly and tight hugs &hellip; passionate massaging to other&rsquo;s body &hellip; exploring every inch of body with wild face and lips moves and it all ended in a 69 suck on shower floor itself and we finally released ourselves mutually at same time on other&rsquo;s chest &hellip; flowing shower water washed it in just few seconds.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, congratulations &hellip; You have passed this round too &hellip; you can give competition to even Kamadeva I must say!&rdquo; I said after a bit of rest following an orgasm we had few seconds ago.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; It was just a trailer sir &hellip; I have much more than this in my bag &hellip; will show you someday later!&rdquo; he said with wink while we both stood up under shower.</p>
                    <p>All that followed by us drying each other in seduction going forward. We also get to wear clothes to each other. Oh Man! It was not just the best fight I ever had in my life &hellip; but it was also a best intercourse in my life! It was almost the first time that I enjoyed the whole experience so much without anal penetration!</p>
                    <p>Anyways, after getting done from all that we again set in the main sitting area of gymnasium and done general chitchat and departing to our respective home to get ready and do packing for upcoming private weekend.</p>
                    <p>The following weekend had multiple passionate sessions of course, but more importantly we got a chance to explore each other&rsquo;s souls in tranquility of hills. We came nearer to each other as friends &hellip; and possibly as partners.</p>
                    <p>We both were happy for our reasons. He was happy that he finally got his years old crush, quite tough and skilled sparring partner for his beloved combat sports and an excellent boss to work with. While I was happy about getting extremely excellent personnel to lead my personal safety team, just as him I too was passionate about combat sports so I too got excellent and tough partner to practice with and as a bonus we both were on extremely pleasant note on personal basis too. It would be fun and soul feeding to work with each other we thought mutually.</p>
