                        pounds extra but, in good shape, around 180lbs in weight and 6’ in height,
                        and right now 22yrs as age. This is my true life wrestling story with my
                        fellow colleague and former schoolmate and best buddy Jay. I had this match
                        when I was 18. At that time also I was looking pretty much like present
                        only when jay was 2 years older than me and height was 6’4” at that time
                        but he weighed quite light maybe 156lbs, but he was an

                        I was doing a summer job in night shift after completing the high school
                        and by co-incidence my ex-school buddy jay also joined my company and in
                        the same department as I was in. For surround environment we were best
                        buddies but internally we know that we both get jealous with each other. We
                        tried to have strength test many times but somehow we can’t done that
                        because in India friendly fight is also quite taboo in public life. But
                        later on we were colleague and doing night shift, then once my parents left
                        the city for couple of days during that days.

                    <p>
                        During my “Home Alone” I offered jay to come at my house as I was alone and
                        he was also alone at his home so we decided to spend some time alone at ma
                        place as it was near to our job venue also. So, we headed to my place after
                        get free from our shift. We took bath at my home then we changed to just
                        shorts and loose sleeveless shirts.(we always keep a pair of access pair of
                        shorts and loose tank-tops as we often visit gym directly after office)
                        Actually I had internal crush upon him. And that day he was looking quit
                        awesome as he was clean shaved and was also in just shorts and sleeveless
                        top, he was also flexing his MUSCLES unconsciously as he was stretching as
                        we were quit tired after long night shift. In short while we both started
                        light exercise together. During that he stared at me and said
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You got quite loose body you little kid....”in taunting manner
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I am only little bit HEAVIER then you.... are you jealous about that? Han?” I replied in same tone
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Why should I get jealous? You know I am NCC guy with heavy military like
                        training and heaving good cuts.... and more having good stamina to take
                        anybody for longer time then you” he replied as he stopped his workout and
                        came near to me in challenging tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “How can you be so overconfident without checking your real strength and
                        stamina with any guy in proper match....I know you have never fought in
                        your whole fucking life till now... I can take you anytime and anywhere for
                        longer time then you” I replied confidently, as I also stopped ma work and
                        gone nearer to him face to face, our bodies was so near that we can feel
                        the warmth of each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh ya? Then what are you waiting for let’s get started right here right
                        now let’s see who’s the boss?” he replied furiously as stepped back and
                        took his place as other end of the quite big room and stand like ready to
                        finish whoever come to him, personally I liked his challenge but dint like
                        his tone...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I stood at ma place for quite some more time looking around room and
                        brushing my hair with ma hands, the room was quite big and with lesser
                        furniture as it was not regular use room and it was just used occasionally
                        to accommodate the excessive guest for short while, though the room had
                        only one sofa set and nothing more in furniture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “What happened to you my little buddy? Are get afraid of just idea to take
                        me on..... Ha ha ha ha” he was again in egoistic voice and I think he was
                        provoking me as well...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh the fucking hell... I can take you on anytime, even in my dreams also
                        and also can defeat you...”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh that’s true Abhijeet, you can only fight and defeat me in your dreams not
                        in reality....ha ha ha” he cut my sentence in the middle and again gave me
                        his egoistic laugh
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Just let me complete you ass hole...”I said furiously going near to him
                        and pointing out warning finger to him. “I am not as mad as you and I have
                        my mind in its place, not like you lost in public fair, so I can think more
                        PRACITACALLY then you” I said in one breath
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “So what’s PRACTICAL thought you looser...” he again smirked in taunting
                        way
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “just shut-up you ass hole, one more time you cut me down in middle and you
                        see....” I shouted furiously and continued. “I was thinking that now we are
                        not kids that can answer every body for visible fight marks and stripped
                        clothes, so if we want to fight then we need to follow some rules as well,
                        some very simple and limited rules”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After giving me some thinking expression he nodded and said “I think you
                        are true punk, by the way what did you think about hiding or avoiding your
                        wounds and stop me to strip down your clothes?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh just stop being so overconfident you palm tree, we will see who’s
                        getting hurt and whose going to be....” somehow I controlled my mind and
                        left that sentence uncompleted as we were living in quit homophobic
                        society, I continued “what I thought is our first fight rule is we will
                        fight in just shorts and second thing anything is allowed except which can
                        give visible wounds”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Okay agreed, now just go in your place and get ready for fight as well as
                        get total humiliation from me” jay replied in serious mood this time
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh we will see who get hurt at the end” I replied in same tone and went to
                        the other end of room and removed my shirt and then turned to face ma pal
                        and opponent for now.
                    </p>

                        By the time he also get his self to shorts showing of his light and toned
                        body, and started to stretching. I also done stretching and get warmed up
                        as A/C of the room was bit high. I was continuously staring at jay’s bare
                        torso and thinking how to extend the fight and defeat this trained hard
                        guy. He was also staring at me same time and same intention I think. We
                        were thinking to stretch the timing of fight because we had whole day to
                        compete as that was Sunday and completely free also, more we were finding
                        such chance from the very first day we met, and discussed about this for
                        couple of times as well, at that time only we decided to stretch the fight
                        time so we can see ACTUAL STAMINA of each other, and this was the day we
                        were looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After some stretching we made our way to center, we were looking straight
                        into each others eyes in challenging way, we stood in that gesture for
                        short while, and then we forcefully slapped our palms with each other to do
                        strength check move, we were forcing each other backward to gain upper
                        hand. Soon I lost balance and jay got chance the chance to gain control
                        over me, by my lost of balance is slammed to floor and dragged jay also
                        with me, but as I said he has a chance to gain upper hand he just grab that
                        chance and quickly moved to my back and grabbed me from my waist and
                        started to applying reverse bear hug on me, I must admit he got the
                        strongest arms I have ever experienced in my life (I dint wrestled many
                        time in adulthood but I did it number of times when I was kid, and this was
                        my experience till date).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start he dint apply all his force, but at the start he was quite
                        gentle and increased his grip slowly and gradually for over 10 minutes.
                        After that I got quite exhausted by his grip and by his taunts like, “what
                        Abhijeet? What happened to your fucking mouth and that all that your big
                        talks hum?” and “do give up buddy before I took out blood from your belly.”
                        I was also feared from thinking about same and thinking about giving up due
                        to overwhelm exhaust and his bare body touch also burning as he got high in
                        temperature as well (he often got high body temperature when he gets anger
                        not because of fever).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But during that he also got tired and loosened his tight and crushing grip.
                        I just tried to escape from but he was quite quick at that time. I
                        continued my useless tries to get upper hand on him. But he dint let me go
                        from his dominance for ten more minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the time I tried to escape and opened his grip from me, he quickly react
                        and grab me again in his strong and stone like arms but this time in
                        frontal bear hug and looked straight into my eyes with fierce, I never saw
                        that much grudge in his eyes before, but then I also got furious and started
                        my tries to escape but he was at his top of his performance and was
                        dedicated to win very first MATCH of his life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, according to his plan he spend ten more minutes to demonstrate his
                        various holds like, camel clutch, half nelson, full nelson, Boston crab,
                        leg figure four, body scissors, head scissors and at the end schoolboy pin,
                        that was last limit for me and also got his crotch near to my face (I
                        always hated the thought of any male’s crotch on my face). So, I gave up
                        and that’s how we ended up with our first wrestling round after almost
                        quite lengthy duration for fight which was about 30minutes. At the end of
                        first round -- JAY (1) and ABHIJEET-ME (0)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After my giving up we went back to our sides and rested for couple of
                        minutes at that time Jay again looked at me with evil and winning smirk on
                        his face and at that time I decide to win next round by hook or by crook to
                        at least tie down the score and show that bitch’s son what UNTRAINED guys
                        like me can do with him. And I also want to dominance on that hell great
                        piece of fighting excellence of professional military training institute.
                        At the same time I was also surprised that how can he do so great without
                        having real fight experience. I was also surprised by my feeling towards
                        his touch. I knew I was straight but still I felt slight different from
                        just having “opponent” thing in mind, I was not sure but I felt some
                        hardness in his crotch also, but I was sure neither he nor me was COMPLETE
                        gay, as we were both into serious relationship and enjoyed normal sex also
                        (I was sure about him also, because apart from that COMPETITIVE feeling we
                        were actually best buddies). But I think it can be sign of Bi-sexual trait
                        also. So, I dint discussed it with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any way after couple of minutes our breath came to normal and he was also
                        cooled down so again we went to the center facing each other in manly
                        manner and started second round with comparatively calm TEST OF STRENGTH.
                        (note the word “comparatively” so it’s sure it was not actual calm start)
                        this time I took enough care of my body balance and maintain it for a
                        while, as the result of my carefulness test of strength was again gone for
                        little longer during which we examined each others body which struggling
                        which other at full power to defeat its opponent. I was surprised that this
                        time he was also staring at me in different manner, it was kind of mixture
                        of fierce and appreciation, I never looked in his eyes so carefully that I
                        can understand what they want to say.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any ways right now we were actually compete with each other on
                        mental and physical level together. Then slowly we get each other in standing
                        mutual headlock. I was just finding the chance to take the fight on the
                        ground because I knew because of my weight I can have upper hand in ground
                        fight only and I also lost my first round mainly because of more standing
                        fight. I knew Jay has an advantage of his length in standing position, even
                        though I was almost 20lbs heavier than him once he lifted me in the first
                        round. So, I was desperate to take him on the ground so I can use my weight
                        advantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In just short while I got the perfect chance to take the fight on the
                        ground while he lost his balance as his leg cam between my thighs and we
                        instantly slammed on ground with me over him. I immediately grab the
                        opportunity and flip him on his chest instantly and just mounted on his
                        back and applied a reverse head lock with applying my whole body pressure
                        on his. I just started ted to crushing his body beneath mine. Headlock ends
                        after 5 minutes of continuous crushing his strong neck muscle, he was
                        almost cold out, but still the moment I loosened my grip he got recover at
                        just lightning speed an flip himself back and face me chest to chest and
                        face to face on the ground.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this time I dint want to lose at any cost so I rapidly applied down
                        face bear hug to him with his both hands tied in it. I continue to squeeze
                        him for almost next 10minutes. Till that time we were heavily sweating so
                        our contact surface was also got quite slippery. As I told he was NCC guy
                        he mastered in self defense techniques as well, so he just grab this
                        condition to free himself and get rapidly free from my hold and rolled
                        aside and stand on to his knees with breathing heavily and gestured me to
                        invite restart the wrestling. This time we remained on knee only as we were
                        quit exhausted and came closure to each other in that position only.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This time we started with standard neutral form of wrestling which shortly
                        lead to the mutual bear hug, we struggled a lot in that position, almost
                        for ten more minutes, after that I noticed that Jay’s grip on me getting
                        loosen, I felt this was the great opportunity and I took it instantly in
                        moved backward to him and get locked him in full nelson, now I was in
                        fierce mood like never before, I just forced his chin into his chest and
                        his vocal tube was also feeling good amount of pressure as he couldn’t
                        speak so much, finally after lots of struggling to win against me he
                        finally gave up and taped out my arm. So that’s the end of round 2 after
                        almost 30 minutes and one hour of whole wrestling with score JAY(1) and
                        ABHIJEET-ME(1).

                    <p>
                        After struggling for one hour continuously we were still undecided in our
                        biggest conflict of our friendship. And the conflict was “who’s the better,
                        stronger and powerful. Whether the guy untrained but slight heavy guy like
                        ME or trained in proper self defense technique but lean guy like JAY? ” the
                        answer was still not there after so much of sweet, struggle, and hateful
                        fight between best buddies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had also one more common question “are we complete straight or complete
                        gay or just between like bisexual?” we might had the answer of first
                        question, we were not complete straight as we both felt excitement with
                        each other’s bare body touch. We clearly felt it during MUTUAL BEARHUG of
                        second round.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any way for that “WHO'S BETTER?” question we arranged third round the “tie
                        breaker round” for that. and as far as “SEXUAL ORIENTATION” question we sat
                        with each other as friends in between the time of next tie breaker round
                        and surf through some hot girls porn snaps and porn videos in my mobile and
                        we find out that we had attraction towards girls, so it’s clear that we
                        were not complete gay even. So we have found out our status as BISEXUAL
                        and to confirm that we had another fight round ahead.
