                    <p>&ldquo;Ooh lovely girl, there's nothing they can do to take you away&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Ooh lovely girl, I can't believe you got me trippin' this way&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I and Vijay woke up the Saturday late morning to this ringtone of Vijay&rsquo;s phone. It was Tushar &ndash; the so called &lsquo;Best Friend&rsquo; of Vijay. At that time Vijay ignored him, put his phone on silent and came back into my arms and rested his head on my chest gently.&nbsp;</p>

            </div>

        <div class="container">

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Though on surface Vijay and Tushar were best friends, but we &ndash; as batch mates always saw their relation as master and slave. Vijay used to treat him as his personal assistant and Tushar used to happily obey his orders. Initially it was odd for us, as on physical basis Tushar was no less than Vijay, to be frank he was way better! Though he was just 18, he was towering 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; against Vijay&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;11&rdquo; and my 6&rsquo;! I and Vijay was of same weight at 175lbs where as he must be touching 190lbs! Though he had almost same sized biceps and chest like I and Vijay, his assets seemed to be way more shredded then us but I never saw him bar chested.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>He was quite old buddy of Vijay and had few matches at Vijay&rsquo;s gym, but never faced Vijay directly. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that Tushar feared of him, I knew that because I saw Tushar defeating the opponents who previously crushed Vijay like a school kid! So he was no way a weak contender.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Anyways, when we finally woke up after a good rest of around 3 more hours after that call, when Vijay checked his phone &ndash; there were 21 missed calls and some N number of messages from Tushar!&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Is this guy gone mad or what! Why the hell he was so anxious about you! Is there something between you two or what?&rdquo; I said making whacky face by seeing that maddening obsession of Tushar.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;There is nothing like you are thinking as of now my cutesy master!&rdquo; He said with his gorgeous dimples on his cheeks with a smiling face and winked. &ldquo;He is just a zero in academics, each and every presentation he gave till date in institute was made by me and I needed to work really hard to prepare him for the class.&rdquo; he added with plain face while going through the messages and replying some of them.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So are you trying to say that he is facing all that humiliation from you for the sake of just presentations?&rdquo; I asked with my eyebrow raised in doubtful manner.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Not just presentations master, we are together from 8<sup>th</sup> grade and he always been looser in each and every subject. It was me who dragged him to the passing grades till we completed the high school!&rdquo; He said with bit of frustrated tone.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;OH &hellip; okay&rdquo; I said with convincing smile and added &ldquo;But still it doesn&rsquo;t explain this kind of obsession!&rdquo; pointing towards his phone.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well you can say it&rsquo;s just interminable bond he have with me naturally. By the time passed, I was not just his academic life support system but I also became an emotional and social saviour of him. His family is orthodox and he is just as Casanova as me, so due to that he got into many troubles from which I saved him countless times. In return I used him as my body guard and assistant. Well he trusts me for his eternal secrets and closeted activities!&rdquo;&nbsp; He said with the dreamy face and added in very mild voice and crushing his tongue lightly between his teeth &ldquo;Shitt!&rdquo; like he uttered out something which he was not supposed to.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I instantly noticed that and said &ldquo;Ooooo &hellip; Eternal secrets!!! Closeted activities!!!&rdquo; with naughty smile and added &ldquo;Just speak up bitch, what those ACTIVITES are?&rdquo; I said in commanding voice.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sorry master, I am your property but not my relations.&rdquo; He said in stern voice and added &ldquo;All you should know is I can and will share details of this night with him as I promised him to do so &hellip; by the way he already knew what we are supposed to do tonight.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>He took out packet of Marlboro and a lighter from the side table&rsquo;s drawer, put one in my lips &hellip; one in his and lit them up. Then he dragged a deep puff and said &ldquo;So you better be ready for another match with Tushar in short time!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I too took a deep puff and replied &ldquo;So now my bitch will let loose his body guard on me!&rdquo; grabbed Vijay from his waist and released second hand smoke in his mouth while smooching and then added &ldquo;Not so manly thing to do, you sexy whore! Just remember that I can also let free my own bodyguard on you too Mr Vijay, so give it a thought before releasing your bull dog on me!&rdquo; by giving a wink &ldquo;And you will definitely get punishment for this disobey of command too!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I am open for punishment but can&rsquo;t share what you are asking. And about Tushar &hellip; it&rsquo;s not exactly as you think master &hellip; he is really in tight emotional bond with me. He looks up to me as a perfect role model and true friend. I know him thoroughly, when he will get to know about tonight and what you did to me, he will surely attempt to take a revenge.&rdquo; Then he took another deep puff and added &ldquo;I can stop him and will pretend to do that too, but he is really a BEAST! I would love to see you conquer him and prove your name right Abhijeet &hellip; my master!&rdquo; he winked and gave a gentle bite on my neck and added further &ldquo;And if you are referring Tilak by your bodyguard, then please feel free about that, he is one tough shit idiot jerk I always wanted to teach a lesson. So I will get that golden chance easily by that!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from giving a soft moan by his bite on my neck. &nbsp;&ldquo;You want me to conquer Tushar! I thought you said you guys have tight emotional bond!&rdquo; I replied recovering from his &ldquo;Further, really beware of Tilak, he can be dangerous. So far I am the only person managed to win him in physical altercation, and in that too I was heavily dependent on my speed then power&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I said Tushar is in emotional bond with me, but never said I am too! I saved him from his family disputes and academic thrashing just to make him my loyal slave. Friendship should never be developed with an inferior!&rdquo;&nbsp; He said with philosophical thoughtful face and added &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about Tilak, he has pissed me a lot, I can definitely manage to dominate the person who has pissed me that much&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Best of luck for Tilak buddy &hellip; you will really need that.&rdquo; I said with real concern and Vijay nodded on that too, then I added &ldquo;In that &lsquo;inferior&rsquo; way, you will always be my bitch Vijay!&rdquo; I took a puff and replied to provoke him. I didn&rsquo;t mean that though.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Master &hellip; I know you consider me a dumb&rdquo; he also took puff, then took my cigarette, cleaned ashes, returned it to me and added &ldquo;But I am not!&rdquo; took another puff&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw my well earned respect in your eyes Abhijeet! You are just pretending to be cocky but I know you do accept that we are on equal level. Let it be physical power, academics, social class or any other matter. Yes things were easy for you in sex match, but that merely is concern of bed &ndash; not in personality or general life! You know I gave you head to head competition in matt fight and it could have been much difficult for you to win in conventional fight!&rdquo; he said and took a last deep breath from his butt and then crushed it in ash tray &hellip; &ldquo;Am I right master?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hmmm &hellip;&rdquo; that&rsquo;s all I could and I thought that I should utter out at that moment. I too took the last puff from my cigarette and handed the remaining to him and he put that in ash tray too.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>He continued &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are, but except for stake timing for now and in future, I am seeing a great friend and bromantic companion in you.&rdquo; He looked at me with smile of hope.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Hmmm &hellip;&rdquo; I took him in my arms, tugged his head in my neck and looked away from his eyes, again that&rsquo;s all I uttered, however this time I wanted to add many things but didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Monosyllabic replies are not acceptable!&rdquo; He said, punched in my ribs and added &ldquo;Tell me clearly if you do not think the same.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Aww &hellip;&rdquo; Punch didn&rsquo;t hurt but as it was unexpected it rather tickled me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, if you are aware about groups in our class, I think it would be hard to maintain our interpersonal relations. We can be friends but our supporters like Tushar and Tilak (My assistant just like Tushar is for Vijay) definitely would not leave their rivalry behind, which ultimately developed as a result of our rivalry. They are so dumb people that now even if we get on to a good note; they will escalate our things further. Do you think our bromance and friendship can blossom in that kind of situation?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;We are TITANS buddy. Yes I know that our dumb minions will fight in between and may be with us too. But we will be ultimate masters of the game; we will dictate the rules and control the happenings. Remember my friend &hellip; wise just fights once, then lets fools to take care of rivalry. We have fought; now onwards let our fools fight.&rdquo; He again said in philosophical expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You mean we will never have a match again?&rdquo; I said in sad tone.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Of course we will have a match again and again! There is difference between fight and match, master!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Oh, that way &hellip; I missed that&rdquo; I said with chuckle and added &ldquo;But still I didn&rsquo;t get you on our followers issue. What you are exactly thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Huh &hellip; in clear words, I would love that our gangs fights with each other, I would love to see the drama between them and I am very sure you would also love that!&rdquo; He replied with devilish smile and added &ldquo;BUT we will not keep the rivalry between us, we will be close companions BUT through back door. Even if our gangs don&rsquo;t fight, we will MAKE SURE that they fight!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I was also thinking the same &hellip; I just wanted to confirm with you and you are pretty good mind reader bitch!&rdquo; I replied and laughed &ldquo;I agree, what else is going in your dirty head?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;We will fuel up the things between our gangs, so that we get to enjoy some great grudge fights, just like Roman war lords used to enjoy gladiators&rsquo; fight! We will be gang lords and peruse our gang to take fight on next level. On institutional level we will be on somewhat neutral level with each other like before &ndash; not so good, not so bad. We will explain that thing as diplomacy to our respective gangs. Anyways, I will just enjoy watching fights, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whose gang member wins.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Cool! That&rsquo;s awesome, I totally agree! Even I want to just enjoy the fights regardless of their wins! Now I am sure that you are as big mastermind as me!&rdquo; I said like I am enlightened by eternal knowledge of universe! &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t explain the Tushar&rsquo;s case &hellip;&rdquo; I added in confusing way.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;What didn&rsquo;t you get master?&rdquo; He also got confused &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I mean what we are planning is the internal fights between our gangs, but you said I need to be ready for Tushar, you can stop him but you won&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s confusing for me&rdquo; I replied&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; he replied and added &ldquo;I said we will not fight with each other, but I am sure you like the tough competitions on mats, so I would throw my gang on you time to time, and as I too like hard-hitting fights, you can also throw your gang on me ... after all you have to agree that our gang members have way better physics than we two. We are their boss because of our minds; physically most of them are better. Let them be physically strong, I am sure we can beat them by our skills, speed and agility. They are just brute force appliers &ndash; while we are ace of combat sports!&rdquo; He replied with devilish smile again.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I was so turned on by his mastermind plan that I couldn&rsquo;t hold my tool much, so I replied &hellip; &ldquo;Great idea bitch!&rdquo; and grabbed his head, placed my lips on his and gave long smooch followed by great passionate sex including 69 and really long bang on his ass.</p>

                <p>Following weekend passed in same kind of activities and on Sunday late night I returned to my home and resumed my vacation with my lady love.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I was really eager for the match with Tushar, I just wanted to crush him badly and make him beg for mercy. It was not just about proving the superiority to Vijay&rsquo;s bitch. The reality was I have always hated the attitude of Tushar. He was utterly snobbish and arrogant dude and epitome of narcissism! Further the word &lsquo;THARKI&rsquo; (Horney bastard) was very short for him; he was like a social jerk always thinking for one and the only thing &hellip; SEX. His tendency to objectify the women was one more reason which irritated me severely &hellip; he just cannot respect the women! I mean Vijay was one horny bastard but he used to respect the women very much, yes ho would flirt with them a lot but would never cross limits until the other girl clearly agrees to go ahead, but Tushar didn&rsquo;t care about all that!</p>
                <p>I and Vijay were anyways moved towards our regular lives. Our friendship has been blossomed awesomely in very short time. Our bromance was increasing by each day and were mostly hanging out together only &ndash; often ditching our &lsquo;Best Friends&rsquo; for each other.</p>
                <p>Then on one particular day in that week, the first encounter of gangs happened between me and Tushar &ndash; as expected. Results were not so pleasant and all I can say as of now is &hellip; it established that what it takes to be an Ultimate Titan and a real MAN!</p>
