                        The first day at Aviation Training School, it was just dream come true for
                        me. Everything was so cool and just like my dream. After all I am in the
                        institute for which I could only dream about till this date and that to at
                        the age of 19! Fortunately it’s reality for me now. Being 6’ in height and
                        having 75kgs weight I was perfect build for any flight steward, even I
                        developed some cuts at that time, so all in all I was in the best shape of
                        my life.

                    <p>
                        At the very first day I met this guy name Vijay. He was a gym trainer and
                        owner; he had a same height and weight as me, even having nice physic and
                        he was a year younger than me. Don’t know why but I had instant dislike or
                        some kind of jealousy and little bit of adore for this guy, I liked his
                        looks and physic may be he is perfect for my fantasies and at the same time
                        I was seeing one tough competitor in him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not sure why I had dislike for him, maybe he was good competition for
                        me or maybe he is having business being younger than me, don’t know what
                        but there was something I dint like about this guy. And one good thing also
                        happen at same day, I met most beautiful girl in my life also on the same
                        day. Just by the thought of being her batch mate for one whole year I was
                        exited like a Kidd! Later on we become committed with each other as well,
                        but that’s one different story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Slowly and gradually classes were taking speed and intensity of training
                        was also increasing. And by the time my and Vijay’s rivalry was also
                        increasing as we were two brightest guys of the batch. We were always
                        finding chance to cut each other off or let another down. For me his most
                        annoying thing was he knew I have crush on Aashka (The girl I have
                        Mentioned earlier), and he was doing too much flirt with her knowing this.
                    </p>

        <div class="container">

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>
                        After a month or so classes were at full peace and also time came when
                        officially student body to be declared for our batch which includes, Chief
                        Class Representative(CCR), Vice Class Representative(VCR), and Grooming
                        Inspector(GI) who is generally Chief Class Representative only. In our
                        Institute Chief Class Representative is most important guy from batch as
                        generally the brightest student among the batch get that post, so it was
                        like I-card of the perfection in every meaning, and l was claiming the post
                        fairly good as during our first month I have performed my every task very
                        well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And finally the big day come, and anticipations about student body came
                        true. I was the Chief Class Representative of our batch. By that post I was
                        certainly the most powerful student in my batch, as Chief Class
                        Representative has much more privileges then other students as he is the
                        one who is responsible for good co-ordination of batch and the batch unity.
                        He is also responsible for the communication between the higher level
                        faculties and batch students, to accomplish that task he generally have
                        direct access to dean’s cabin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But despite of getting this achievement I was not so happy, as Vijay was
                        Vice Class Representative of the batch. For me it was not easy thing to
                        digest as our post made us to work with each other even more as CR and VCR
                        are supposed to do work as team and they are supposed to handle all the
                        event with each others co-ordination. Means now I was supposed to spend
                        EXTRA time with my enemy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And more as student co-coordinators we both were responsible to manage one
                        important function of our institute. All in all we were going bare each
                        other for next two full months! After getting the projects together our
                        rivalry came on the skin as well. Now it visible to other batch mates even.
                        We were always in hidden competition to let each other down, and if
                        anything was less, some idiot batch mates were enjoying all this drama so
                        they were fueling the competition even more.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>
                        At one point it was too much to handle at one go. At that day my and
                        Vijay’s rivalry goes physical. It was not that intense but yeah if we were
                        not in institute or having other batch mates around then yeah probably it
                        would be the day when we would fight each other to the extreme level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At that day Boys Gang of batch were passing the time in institute’s parking
                        lot after our sessions. Again I and Vijay together winded up regular
                        documentation of batch’s attendance and grooming report so we were last to
                        came out from building, where all boys were waiting for us to plan the meet
                        for the dance rehearsals for the event. At that time I was bit tired after
                        a day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So some guy commented “Hey Abhijeet, why are you looking down today?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Nothing dudes. Just got tired after a hard day.” I replied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You know what gujju guys can’t do enough hard work for longer. They are so
                        lazy!” Vijay replied to that in taunting voice. (‘gujju’ are the guys or
                        girls or anything else hails from State Of Gujarat, Vijay was not from
                        Gujarat.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “After enjoying an easy day in A/C class anybody can say that. Just try out
                        the things which we do regularly in Gujarat! We can beat Marwadi (‘marwadi’
                        who hails for Marwad Region of India) guys in every manner.” I replied in
                        annoying voice, though I dint intended to go racial but my annoyance
                        towards Vijay made me do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh, yeah? Just try out anytime man! I always ready to prove you wrong my
                        fellow colleague! ” he said in challenging way by coming straight face to
                        face with me, I think it was not just couple of racial comments fueling us
                        but it was gathering rage of over two months that was coming on skin at
                        that day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You really think that you can take me on you punk! No chance you can stand
                        against me. Neither in class performance nor on ground!” had even I replied
                        more specific challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You are welcome to check it out ANYTIME ANYWHERE Mr Class Representative.”
                        he said with unbuttoning the sleeves and revealing nice cleavage of
                        muscular chest by unbuttoning the upper buttons of shirt and having
                        sarcastic smile, I also did the same in reply and get myself mentally ready
                        for fight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By this we just clenched the fists and ready for the brawl at the moment,
                        but as it was public place our friends cooled us down. In meantime some guy
                        said “hey guys if you dislike each other that much and always proving
                        yourself better than other then why don’t you have one match to finalize
                        it!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wow! A match with my FAVORITE rival! Not a bad idea at all! I mentioned
                        one thing earlier as well; apart from our rivalry I admired Vijay for his
                        personality and his looks. He was truly an eye candy! Even I was very much
                        good looking and heartthrob of the batch at that time. But if there was
                        somebody in the batch on whom I can have gay crush then he was the Vijay!
                        If he doesn’t flirt with my girl then we would be good friends and may be
                        even more! ;)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many time I fantasized about the sexy submission wrestling between me and
                        him. And more I had a doubt that he was even Bi-Sexual just like me, as
                        during dance practice of event many times I saw little boner in his jeans
                        after some intimate moments with males! May be it can be just my over
                        observation but anyhow that was what I observed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway let’s come again on track, in short someone was setting up direct
                        match between me and Vijay!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Leave it dude, Abhijeet don’t have enough guts to face me! You know I take
                        on toughest bodybuilders regularly at my gym and I am totally undefeated!
                        Then what does this WHITE COLLAR guy have stand against me!” he commented
                        on the suggestion in insulting manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Anytime you want to check your senior colleague my friend!” I said in
                        anger by going again near to him with clenched fists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our biceps were bugling out of our tight formal shirts because of
                        increasing rage in us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Hey hey hey, cool down guys. Don’t take it seriously! I was just talking
                        about one healthy arm wrestling match. Don’t get this much serious!” the
                        guy replied on our face off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Sure, I can take on this Marwadi in any kind off match anytime. It’s an
                        open challenge from me!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh yeah? Then come on you pretty face, let me show you your exact level.
                        After all just good face do not determine the real MAN!” he replied and
                        placed his elbow on one nearby motorcycle seat in challenging gesture for
                        arm wrestling…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Anytime you punk… just one thing, there’s need of some stakes to make this
                        match more meaning full, you know! “ I replied in anger by accepting the
                        challenge and we met our palms in center of that seat end put our other arm
                        on back…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Stakes! Good idea you punk, I agree for whatever stakes you want punk!
                        Because I know it will be you who need to pay stakes, so think once before
                        putting stakes!” he replies with an arrogate smile, I just felt that I
                        should hit him straight in his nose at that time, but somehow I managed my
                        anger…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “stakes are very simple, looser will submit himself totally to winner and
                        will never argue with the winner throughout the batch duration, not just
                        this he need to obey each and every wish of the winner, and yeah most
                        important thing, looser will give-up his post willingly. In short it’s all
                        or nothing!” I said in sarcastic way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Whatever you want buddy, get ready to give your resignation, yeah I can
                        give you some time to write the resignation latter so that you can recover
                        from your injured hand!” he again said in taunting way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Time will say who is resigning.” I said in confident way.
                    </p>

                        Now it was about to on… two extreme rivals were going compete for their
                        pride, for their glory and to prove their self as better leader as well.
                        And most important thing, it was a fight to EARNING THE POST! As looser was
                        supposed to resign from the post!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As soon as our grips were secure, Vijay said "Let’s Get on Business Buddy"
                        and we both poured on the power. I have to admit, this muscle boy was even
                        stronger than I expected. This gym stud is holding up better than most of
                        the heavyweight bodybuilders I saw.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We jockeyed for position, back and forth, getting familiar with our
                        opponent and trying to figure what he would do next while trying to gauge
                        just how much power was locked in those considerable arms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr VCR was confident and from the look of those muscles bulging out of
                        shirt fabric I could certainly see why. The guy wanted to play with me and
                        put on a show before putting me out of my misery, but I had plans of my
                        own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In one rapid move, I poured all my strength into my wrist and powered over
                        the top bending the rival boy's wrist back then using the element of
                        surprise and his loss of concentration to my advantage, I powered up
                        forcing the stud's big arm about half way to the table before he caught
                        himself. The gym trainer's arm exploded with muscle and he was able to
                        temporarily stop my downward momentum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My suspicions that my muscular opponent had spent his time arm wrestling
                        local bodybuilders of his area and had probably not seen much real
                        competition were proven true. The guy was all muscle and having less
                        technic then I expected from a GYM OWNER.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm sure he has very little trouble to overwhelming most guys from his gym,
                        stupid enough to face him, he's just never faced a man with power AND
                        skill, a fatal mistake in this game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stud was flexing hard. The big sarcastic smile on his face was gone and I
                        got the distinct impression that the big stud was in a position he had
                        probably never seen before. The guy's muscles were a treat to behold. I
                        couldn't get over how great he looked with his broad shoulders, thick traps
                        and amazingly powerful neck; all flexed hard even out of formal shirt! I
                        stretched his arm out both to wear him down some more and to see that
                        massive biceps grow even larger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was no doubt that this gym trainer was a true fighter and he wore his
                        "Undefeated" title proudly. He was in big trouble for the first time and
                        risked getting beat in front of the nasty batch mates AND gets beaten by a
                        "WHITE COLLAR GUY" that he had challenged! Vijay was fully aware of the
                        stakes and was not about to consider failure as an option
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The gym stud gasped a giant breath and his chest flexed to impressive size.
                        Damn, I could see the definition of his abs stretching against his tight
                        shirt! This man if fucking STRONG! Inexperience is a tough teacher. While
                        the stud didn't know it, I knew well that once a man comes over the top and
                        gets your wrist back, you're a dead man in this game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't care how damn strong you think you are, you don't come back from
                        that point, at best, and it’s just a matter of time. Vijay just didn't know
                        when to give up and I was enjoying the entertainment of watching those
                        handsome muscles fighting back. I had no reason to put him away yet so I
                        let him fight me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The boy gang was going nuts! "Look at that!" "I don't believe it. Abhijeet is
                        holding Vijay! I always thought Vijay is one tough guy!" one batch mate
                        said impressed by my power. "God, Abhijeet must be a He-man or something.
                        NOBODY is stronger than Vijay in our area!" a guy from Vijay’s area
                        exclaimed. "Shit, man! Check out Vijay’s bulging biceps. Look at all that
                        muscle! I say he comes back and kicks the pretty boy’s ass! Come on, Vijay!
                        Do it man! Reach down and show this pretty face that who's boss!" one of
                        the Vijay’s fan said. "Vijay’s a horse, man. He isn’t never been beat and I
                        say he won't start now!" again the guy from his are said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The batch crowd from Vijay’s area was obviously on his side as they always
                        followed what Vijay told them about exercise and power and used to see him
                        win, but they dint have idea that a guy from so called WHITE CALLER class
                        can hold his own and they clearly didn't know how much trouble their hero
                        was in or that there was no way he could win now. This could be some real
                        fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next time Mr VCR flexed, I let his big arm back up slightly but I still
                        poured on a ton of resistance. The cards were stacked in my favour but that
                        doesn't mean I wasn't up against an absolutely amazing display of brute
                        force! No doubt about it, this stud had more natural power than any gym guy
                        I had ever seen. I got to see how deep that power goes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stud has strength, but does he have guts? Seeing his arm working its
                        way back up, even just a little, and was enough to give the stud a new
                        lease on life. My raging opponent clinched his powerful jaw and poured an
                        incredible amount of power into those thick muscles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have to admit that he caught me by surprise, I had no idea the stud was
                        capable of that kind of force. After the strain I had already placed on
                        that massive arm. I didn't even have to let up on him, Vijay was forcing
                        our arms back all by himself! SHIT! I thought to myself. This stud must
                        have some kind of atomic power plant buried inside those cannons of his!
                        Imagine some poor body builder having to face this dude on the mats and
                        getting caught in those guns! Terrifying!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's going on here? I'm getting lost in the admiration of this muscle
                        stud and he's already powered his way back nearly to the neutral position.
                        If this guy is able to work my arm down, he could have enough power and
                        leverage to bring his wrist around and I will be the dead man. For my sake,
                        I hope he's exhausted his immense storehouse of reserve power getting back
                        to his point because if this dude can crank like that again, I'm not sure I
                        could hold him back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Boys were insane at this point. "Holy Shit! Look at Vijay's arm, man! I've
                        NEVER seen muscle like that!" The guy was right. The Vijay’s biceps must be
                        peaking at 19" or more! The tissue thin skin was stretched so tight in
                        became nearly invisible and every thick cable of sinew roped across the
                        twin peaks of the gym guy’s massive upper arm. His slight whitish color
                        gave the appearance of polished brown wood. In serious battle the Vijay's
                        fully flexed physique resembled a carved statue, except that no one would
                        ever believe someone at 18 could develop such size and power!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What the fuck! While I'm lost in the amazing sight before me, this stud has
                        powered my arm past the mid-point! That and the support of the screaming
                        crowd have given the Gym Stud a second wind. This guy is totally ignoring
                        the tearing pain his wrist must be providing and working to take me down
                        using nothing but absolute, unadulterated power!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OK! Now it’s more than enough admiration of the dashing classmate. I'm not
                        going to let him walk all over me, just because he can! This guy has to be
                        completely spent by now. His huge biceps has been locked in battle for too
                        long. No man can put out that much force at full flex without exhausting
                        the muscle! My own big guns have been taking it easy. I'm still fairly
                        rested and I figure he's about done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I begin to muscle up to show this stud what a WHITE CALLER face can do, but
                        our arms don't move! Damn! This shit is even stronger than I thought. I
                        flex again with even greater force and my arm fills the sleeve stretching
                        the fabric of my dress shirt tight. Our audience comes unglued! All the
                        cheers for their heroes to put other away begin to quiet down as our arms
                        return to the neutral position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The muscle boy grunts and even groans for the first time. It's hard to tell
                        but I think I can detect a question in his eyes. For the first time Vijay
                        may be wondering if he will have what it takes to win this battle?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both big arms are trembling from the amazing force of two very powerful
                        men, but the game is yet to be decided. I flex again and my big guns are
                        more than my shirt was designed to hold. Our youthful audience is astounded
                        as my biceps were bugling out of my shirt and they never imagined that I
                        too can have body like Vijay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first time, Vijay gets a good eyeful of what he's fighting and at
                        that same moment, I add more power forcing his big arm down another couple
                        of inches. Sweat is beginning to run down the handsome dude's face. The
                        combatant is still pouring on incredible power but he's still slowly losing
                        ground. The stud fights and fights hard! He grunts and groans, but won't
                        give in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally with every remaining effort in his incredibly muscular body, once
                        again the massive arms stop their downward motion. One more time the
                        muscular superhero has saved him from destruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I look at the stud before me and marvel at his amazing strength. This guy
                        has one incredible build and is one hell of a fighter. I could take him
                        down and put him out of his misery. I could ease up on him and watch those
                        beautiful muscles fight back again; I could even let him take me. I mean,
                        what would be the problem in that? I enjoys the sexy submission fights with
                        these kind of muscle guys. Imagine what a story that would make in his gym.
                        This guy is already a local legend, that story would be his insurance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One glance at the struggling muscleman across the motorcycle from me made
                        up my mind. He challenged me! What if the tables were reversed? I'm a
                        fighter and I don't fight to lose! Undefeated MY ASS!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began to slowly tighten my grip on the stud's thick hand as I whispered
                        across the table. "You know, I can crush the shit out of your hand and put
                        you out of competition for the rest of the batch. You're in way over your
                        head, muscle guy!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The wrestler looked me square in the eye. I was smiling but he wasn't
                        really sure how serious I might be. Our massive arms were locked halfway to
                        the bike seat. If it were closer, a man could recognize defeat and give it
                        up, but at this level there was still a chance to win. No real fighter
                        would pack it in. I had him! Mentally and physically, he was beaten. He
                        just didn't know it yet!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I stretched his big arm out a little more, leverage was all mine. Vijay was
                        fighting back with everything he had but that was becoming less and less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As he fought, our arms would move slightly back toward neutral, then after
                        a moment, I would force them back down again. The pumping motion was
                        working on his massive arm and his biceps looked like it was ready to
                        explode! I watched the amazing muscle work and I think I noticed the change
                        even before he did. You could see a wave starting at the elbow and moving
                        gently up the mountain of muscle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The buff body builder now noticed it too, but he felt it before he saw it.
                        The massive biceps was cramping! You can only ask a muscle to do so much
                        and tonight he had demanded more of his muscular physique than ever before.
                        Now Super boy of batch was going to pay the price!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I let his big arm up a couple of inches and the batch mates went crazy
                        thinking that Vijay was making a comeback again, but we both knew better.
                        The VCR knew what I was up to. I let him power up, just so I could press
                        his big arm back down. I was pumping those guns and feeding the pains.
                        Vijay’s knotted up muscles are going to provide him a great deal of more
                        pain than I would ever be willing to do myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A second wave then a third and fourth swept up the mountain of muscle. Each
                        wave was wider and a great more painful than the one before it. I could see
                        the stud's eyes water with pain. He wanted to quit, but he couldn't, not in
                        front of all of his fans!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I pumped his powerful arm a few more times just for the fun of watching the
                        big guy's upper arm go into shaking. Shit! That's got to really hurt!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vijay's expression changed as though suddenly he had become someone else.
                        The younger guy was whipped! The big, tough gym trainer was completely done
                        and defenseless in my grip. I tightened my hold on his hand and whispered
                        for only him to hear "Are you about done Mr VCR?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vijay looked me square in the eye for one long painful moment, and then
                        slowly nodded 'yes'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I could do anything I wanted at that point, but decided I'd had enough fun
                        and simply slammed his wrist to the table top.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vijay was relieved to have it over. Boys were stunned. "Shit! I can't
                        freaking believe it!" "Someone actually took Vijay!" "My eyes! My eyes must
                        be lying to me!" "It' can't be!" "Man, that nerdy CR dude must be
                        Superman!" and more was murmuring between his fan group, and I sure as hell
                        felt like it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than just slamming him down and releasing him I held Vijay's
                        powerful arm to the table for a long painful moment, just because I could
                        and I felt so "in control" doing it. "Seriously dude! Really a gym trainer!
                        “ I whispered across the motorcycle as I gave his hand one more convincing
                        grip just to see his eyes crooked with pain then released the big stud and
                        casually commented "Ready for resign Mr Vice Class Representative?" having
                        victory smile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As stakes was decided, Vijay wrote his resignation from the post on second
                        day for which he faced endless questions from management and by the end of
                        day his resignation was accepted and I had the power to assign new one, and
                        I did what I wanted as I appointed Aashka - my lady love as Vice Class
                        Representative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the class Vijay came to me having faint smile on his face,
                        “Congratulations Abhijeet. You two are making nice couple.” He said
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Thank You very much for greeting you looser.” I said with victory
                        confidence and smile. I know it was bit rude and arrogant but I can’t hide
                        my emotions after my benchmark victory over Vijay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You are getting overconfident about your power man. That was just
                        arm-wrestling, someday try me in real combat, just we two, man on man,
                        straight to mats, no rounds and tapping, no nothing, just applying raw
                        power on each other and fight till complete exhaustion of looser. Then I am
                        sure we would have definitely one clear winner!” he replied with annoyed
                        voice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “So, the looser is asking for rematch! Hmm ... Sure dude. Anytime anywhere,
                        I am all ready to beat you.” I said with haughty voice and having bright
                        spark in eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Sure, someday at my gym, just you and me, no audience to stop us! And yeah
                        the stakes will be much higher than just resigning from post. Accepted?” he
                        said with confident and evil smile. By his last sentence I was bit confused
                        and worried, what was his meaning by “Stakes will be much higher than just
                        resigning?” I wanted to clarify it but thought it will look like I am
                        scared about the challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Whatever you wish punk. I will be waiting to kick your ass literally!” I
                        said with confidence, and he moved away with some mischievous smile on his
                        face and we parted for the day.

                    Now I was really eager about the match and the BIG STAKES he was talking
                    about. And to be friendly i was really impressed how he fought last day.
                    Now my attraction toward him converted in lust toward him and the real
                    fight was one chance to win it! May be I was too optimistic or silly but
                    that was all I wanted, and now I am waiting for real MATCH between us! ;)
