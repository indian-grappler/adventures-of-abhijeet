                    <p>After having shameful defeat in second round I was just astonished by the power of kid and was breathing heavily to recover. Jaimin was just beside me and I was also enjoying his bare skin touch and planning for the last round. After some time we stood up and shake our hand and hugged to end up the round.</p>
                    <p>Then we headed to our respective corner to get ready for the final round. As to get ready for last round we were unwrapping our dhotis and I stuck my eyes on Jaimin as he was also getting ready for the next fight and unwrapping his dhoti and after very long time I saw him in briefs and I tell you there was nothing like to see Jaimin in briefs, yes he is little bit soft in built but there was something sexy about him.</p>
                    <p>By the time I was also thinking about our fight and my inner sensation like what if I will cum? More important what if Jaimin got to know that I came by touch of him, as he was heterosexual guy it will embarrassing moment for him also. But there was very less chance that he can notice my cum, as I was in completely black briefs and more it was already quite wet by sweat so I was safe I thought.</p>
                    <p>As soon as we unwrapped our dhotis we done some stretching as score were even and the last round will decide the winner. So any how I got reed off from my naughty thoughts and started planning to defeat this strong kid in last round and win our first friendly fight. Now he was in total competitive mood and in full form so it is not going to be easy task to take this wild horse under control and lot more difficult to defeat him.</p>
                    <p>He was warming up his body very harshly and fiercely. In that heating room he was adding more heat by his stretching and warm-up, he got all sweaty and looking even sexier in that condition. But again concentrating on upcoming fight I also done good warm-up and stretching as just planning won&rsquo;t work against this bulldozer, I also need to increase my power output also.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>After some warm-up we again meet in center and hugged to start the match. Jaimin was totally in mood to defeat me as his eyes was filled up with fierce and eagerness to take me head-on and he was thinking like he want me to know who&rsquo;s the boss in society and his street fights were not just boasting but it all were reality. At the same time even I convinced myself to concentrate on pure fighting nothing else and I was also thinking to beat creep out of him.</p>
                    <p>So one thing was very clear by the time third and last round begins and that was that that this round is not going to be an average one, it will longer in time span and very hard-fought and rougher then ever&hellip;</p>
                    <p>So after the handshake and hug Jaimin lean to take his position underneath as he enjoyed upper position in second round, so now I will be on the top for this round. As soon as he took his position he signaled me to take my position and then I headed towards his right and sat on my right knee on and left leg on the mat and then leaned on his back the slide my right hand under his chest and took his left arm in my hand and grabbed his waist with my another arm.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Ready You Punk?&rdquo; I again asked in teasing tone to get him angry.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Who was the punk that we have seen in last round and again I am ready to kick your ass once again&rdquo;, he said confidently.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get the hell started&rdquo;, I said in fierce mood and then the most important round for both of us was bang on started.</p>
                    <p>I also tried to jerk him same he did with me in last round but he was a lot quicker then me and got himself totally flat on the mat. Even I lose my balance for a split second as he literally grabbed me with his body and I also gone on top of him, but somehow I managed myself to take control on me and I landed on him with my whole body over him.</p>
                    <p>Now we were struggling to get upper hand upon each other, I had little bit upper hand already as I was on top him while he was facing the matt underneath me, but in even this situation he forced me for quite tough hustling for almost five more minutes.</p>
                    <p>I can get much progress during this time as he was continuously resting my attacks even being underneath. But despite of that much hustling I got success to wrap my legs over his lower body and now I can take him in control.</p>
                    <p>So I now started trying to applying moves on his upper body, and in a long sequence of useless trial like to grab him in reverse bear hug, capture him in camel clutch, taking his arms back and twisting them hardly and god know how many more but not even single was successful as Jaimin was quite quick, smart and rough guy to fight.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>He was escaping from every move that I started applying on him like when I tried to get him in reverse bear hug he putted all pressure in his arms and spread them widely and stuck his body on the matt like he is stuck there by birth, then started jerking himself very roughly and fiercely when I attempted a camel clutch on him, and took both arms upwards with tremendous strength when I wanted to take them in back and twist them.</p>
                    <p>All this and lot more gone for quite long time then luckily I got good chance to attempt half nelson him after almost 10 minutes of hard fight. I somehow manage to slide my right arms underneath his right underarm and placed my palm on his neck, and then I started to apply pressure on his neck with the help of my left arm.</p>
                    <p>Finally the wild horse was in my control after almost 15 minutes of hard fight and tom-n- jerry chase type of hold chasing. But I must tell you that it was just starting of the fight, there is long way to be done to beat this kickass guy. I maintained this hold for 5 for minutes onto him so I could strain out all his strength.</p>
                    <p>He was in my leg scissors and half nelson for almost 10minutes now and I dint done different in this time span as I needed some time to recover from this and planning for what next. But during this time he continuously resist me and trying get himself free from me but I was also a strong guy and dint allow him to succeed in his tries.</p>
                    <p>But after some time even I got tired and losing my stamina rapidly and I loosen the grip of nelson, I think Jaimin also getting tired by the time as he also reduced his tries to get free. But I thought I was totally wrong!!! The moment I loosen up my grip he showed the lightning speed like any python and just escaped with his all his body just in split second and now he was on the knees in front of me, all free without any control and I was lying vulnerable on the mat.</p>
                    <p>He just then flipped me in another more moment and crawled on me and covered me with his as massive body as me and he applied the absolute new hold that I never heard about that till this time and I calling this as frontal full nelson. What he had done was he slipped his both arms under my underarms and bring them in front of my throat passing my shoulder and locked his palms in my throat and started applying pressure backwards.</p>
                    <p>It was most painful thing I have ever experienced; I was feeling like my throat is literally choking as he was applying tremendous pressure. I was feeling like I will lose my consciousness if I will not get reed from this hold. So I need to respond before I again dominated again by my best childhood buddy.</p>
                    <p>But he was so harsh that he dint left any gape to escape. He was covering my chest with his upper torso and that how he blocked my arms for any kind of movement. But somehow I was also a strong and smart guy, so I cannot give up this easy.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>So I found one way to escape from this odd situation. My hands were on both side of his upper body so I decided to sleep them in-between ourselves and I got success in that. And then I started to push him away from me and applied all pressure I can apply at that point of time, but as I had told you Jaimin is tough guy, initially there was null effect on him but I dint stopped trying and continue my try, soon he started responding as I reached at his chest and applied all the pressure I had. And slowly and gradually he I got success to push him away enough so I can move myself away from him.</p>
                    <p>Then I just showed lightning strike and pushed him away from me with all strength I had, and it worked!!! I throw him in air and he landed about two feet in my right and lying on his back. He and I both were astonished by this. I think it my body fight or flight policy showed its importance and gave out amazing output when my life was in danger by the monster(it&rsquo;s just kind of description of his amazing aggression and power, otherwise I never consider Jaimin as a real monster&hellip; hahaha&hellip;lolz)</p>
                    <p>Then we both gathered ourselves quickly as match still going on and soon we were in knee standing position with our forearms in another&rsquo;s hold and struggling for upper hand, we were hustling very harshly and rigidly. Soon we were again on the matt and grabbed each other in cross mutual bear hug.</p>
                    <p>We were rolling here and there with having each other in our tight hug and trying to get more harsh hold over another. We were in searching for some sort of match ending hold. But after 10 minutes of harsh hustling we dint get any kind of success and we were actually showered with our sweat.</p>
                    <p>We both were very rigid kid so fight was getting extended and even harsher by each passing moment. Suddenly I got idea and suddenly stood on my knee with having Jaimin still having in my hug and then within in split second I slammed Jaimin on the matt having his face up.</p>
                    <p>He got major shockwave by my move and his hug was lost. This time I dint want to give him any chance of recovering so I showed amazing speed and flipped with his belly down and grabbed him by his waist and pulled him up and slipped another hand across his neck and started applying pressure on both, stomach and neck. Now he was again in my control after almost 30 minutes of hard fight.</p>
                    <p>But somehow I thought still victory is far away as Jaimin is real stubborn kid, and he is strong kid just reverse bear hug and neck choke wouldn&rsquo;t enough to make him submit. So I was using that move to take some time so I can think about some different hold that can put full stop on this EXTRA EXTENDED match.</p>
                    <p>After taking full control of this wild horse I started preparation of some more serious hold by starting to take him between my legs and started applying pressure on his lower body. After I made sure that he cannot escape again I flipped him again on the matt with his belly down and crawled on his lower back and sat on him and then reached for his chin and started to pulling his face up</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;aaaarrrrgggghhhh, nooooooooooo&hellip;..&rdquo; he cried out for the first time.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;This is nothing my dear friend there is much more in my suitcase, all just for you my best buddy.&rdquo; I said in taunting voice.</p>
                    <p>He again get annoyed by this and jerked his body harshly, but this time I was all ready for this and it dint made any difference on my hold. He was now in real pain, but the jerk was not ready to give up. So by each passing moment I increased the pressure and by this his screaming got higher. I was sort of enjoying this after all the most stubborn kid of my circle is under domination of mine right now. I was on seventh heaven.</p>
                    <p>But I wanted to play some more time with him so I let him go from the camel clutch, he was loosen that he dint showed any movement on releasing, he was just crying in pain, so I took this as advantage and pulled his both arms backwards and crossed them in opposite and started to twisting them on his back, again his cries get louder in pain. I never saw him crying like that. So I played with him for 10 more minutes just like this.</p>
                    <p>Then after some time I also get tired and loosing stamina also. So I decided to put full stop on this tom-n-jerry chase and end up this match by one solid and guaranteed hold I ever know the BOSTON CRAB!!!</p>
                    <p>So I just turned towards his legs and pulled his leg one by one and held them with my arms and started pulling them back and that was it, that was it!!! The pressure on his body was tremendous.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Come you jerk give up now and save both of us time, after all it&rsquo;s over 45 minutes that I am dominating you, there is no chance that you can come back into fight!!!&rdquo; I said in attitude and laughed</p>
                    <p>But the kid was real steel and dint gave for 5 more minutes then I just stood up on my legs and pulled his legs almost on 90degree.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Okay okay, I am giving, I am giving&hellip;.&rdquo;and he tapped rapidly on the matt.</p>
                    <p>Aah what a soul filling sound that was!!! After almost an hour of very harsh, very hard, very rough and very rigid fight I got success to take tap from this extravagantly violate and strong and stubborn guy. I was in seventh heaven and on ninth cloud!!! I won this round!!! I won this match!!! I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it if I dint found Jaimin lying under me crying in pain.</p>
                </div>

        <div class="container">

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>I just throw my self besides him. And we both were breathing heavily and recovering from very tiring match; we started in afternoon and now its late evening!!! So by that only you can imagine how long our match gone.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Are you okay my friend?&rdquo; I ask with sympathy voice.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;he just nodded his head.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I am sorry if I hurt you, I dint mean that, but you were not giving up so what else I can do at that time?&rdquo; I was actually feeling guilty by seeing him in pain.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay buddy, I would do the same if I was in place of you, and to be very frankly I enjoyed the fight through, that was dream fight I can ever imagine, I enjoyed whether I was dominating you or you were dominating me, after all it was real equal give-n-take fight as I always wanted to have, so don&rsquo;t feel guilty about it!!!&rdquo; he said as he recovered and stood up on his own and I also stood up.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I would also like to congratulate you to putting good fight and giving me a good fight. I will always want a fight like this only. Thanks buddy.&rdquo; I said him as I took him in friendly hug and he lifted me up in the air gently to show his sportsmanship.</p>
                    <p>That&rsquo;s how I ended up with the best fight I ever fought and with the best opponent I have ever got till that time. After this fight I started truly respect Jaimin and I felt the same from his side. It was some of the most memorable times in my life I must say and I think every guy and especially wrestlers must have that kind of experience at least once in life. It&rsquo;s like a lifetime achievement guys, really!!!</p>
